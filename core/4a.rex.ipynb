HIGHWAY.  AFTERNOON.  A ribbon of freeway stretching into a blue and pink late afternoon sky. A huge dark sedan, windows tinted gold, headlights blazing, powers directly for us.  CUT TO: A heavy, low-slung, pickup truck traveling toward the sedan.  WIDE SHOT: Sky, freeway, the cars closing.  TIGHT ON: The sedan.  TIGHT ON: The pickup.  Like thunderous, jousting opponents, the cars pass in a deafening cacophony of noise.  INT.  TRUCK.  AFTERNOON.

He and the pimply-faced front-seat passenger, SAMPSON, explode with laughter.  The red-haired driver BENVOLIO, keeps his eyes on the road.  EXT.  EXIT RAMP.  AFTERNOON.  The truck spirals down an exit ramp and screeches into busy driveway of a large gas station.  EXT.  GAS STATION.  AFTERNOON.  Attendants immediately run to the truck.  Two clean windshields and duco, the third fills the gas tank.  INT.  TRUCK.  AFTERNOON.  Gregory in the back seat is boasting outrageously.                           GREGORY             A dog of that house shall move me             to stand.  I will take the wall of             any man or maid of Capulets.  Sampson, sarcastically.                           SAMPSON             That shows thee a weak slave.  For             the weakest goes to the wall.                           GREGORY             \\'Tis true; and therefore women,             being the weaker vessels, are ever             thrust to the wall.  Therefore, I             will push Capulet\\'s men from the             wall, and thrust his maids to the             wall.  Benvolio, disgusted, gets out of the car.                           BENVOLIO             The quarrel is between our masters...                           GREGORY                    (yelling after him)             ...and us their men.  EXT.  GAS STATION.  AFTERNOON.

SUPER FAST SCAN TRACK: Past the mother to - the huge black sedan pulling up outside the gas station mini-mart.  The front door of the sedan opens.  Shiny black boots - decorated with tiny, silver, cat-shaped spurs - plant themselves on the ground.  The boots are joined by two other pairs of well-shod feet.  HOLD: The spurred boots move out of frame.  CRANE UP: The other feet belong to a tough-looking Latin youth ABRA - and his goateed side-kick PETRUCHIO.

Sampson is trying to out boast Gregory.                           SAMPSON             I will show myself a tyrant.  When             I have fought with the men I will             be civil with the maids, I will cut             off their heads.  Gregory; mock outrage.                           GREGORY             The heads of the maids?  Sampson leers lecherously at the girls.                           SAMPSON             Ay, the heads of the maids, or             their maiden heads, take it in what             sense thou wilt.                           GREGORY             They must take it in sense that             feel it.  Gregory and Sampson pump up the song on the sound system and sing out at the girls.                           GREGORY/SAMPSON                    (singing)             I am a pretty piece of flesh!             I am a pretty piece of flesh!             Me, they shall feel while I am able             to stand;             I am a pretty piece of flesh!  The girls, pretending not to notice, get into the car.  EXT.  GAS STATION - MINIMART.  AFTERNOON.

SLAM ZOOM: To Benvolio - weapon outstretched he screams:                           BENVOLIO             Part, fools! You know not what you             do!  MUSIC STING; A SUPER MARCO SLAM ZOOM along the barrel of Benvolio\\'s gun; the engraved gun type reads:  \\'Sword 9mm series S\\'  CUT TO: Benvolio. He screams in desperation:                           BENVOLIO             Put up your swords!  Gregory, Sampson, Abra, and Petruchio freeze.  A moment - then from behind, the unmistakable sound of a gun being cocked.  EXTREME CLOSE UP: The black cowboy boots.  CRANE UP: To find the dark cold eyes and feline smile, of the wearer of the boots. His name is TYBALT; a cigarette is clenched between his teeth and his gun is aimed at Benvolio\\'s head.                           TYBALT             What, art thou drawn amoung these             heartless hinds?             Turn thee Benvolio.  Benvolio, a choked explanation:                           BENVOLIO             I do but keep the peace.  A mocking smile.                           TYBALT             Peace? I hate the word             As I hate hell, all Montagues, and...  EXTREME CLOSE UP: Tybalt\\'s finger squeezing the trigger...  Suddenly we hear firing from Tybalt\\'s blind side.  Tybalt redirects his weapon, cracking off a single shot at the surprise attacker.  EXT./INT.  MINIMART.  AFTERNOON.  It is the five year old from the station wagon. The bullet smacks the toy gun from the child\\'s hand, shattering the wagon\\'s window.  Mother and children scream.  EXT.  GAS STATION.  AFTERNOON.  A panicked Benvolio falls back, accidentally his gun fires - the bullet whistles past Tybalt\\'s head.  Tybalt combat rolls, and using a screaming car load of girls as cover, returns two quick shots, narrowly missing Benvolio.  EXT.  GAS STATION.  AFTERNOON.  The gas station attendant hits a button and heavy metal screens slam down.  EXT.  GAS STATION.  AFTERNOON.  CUT TO: Gregory firing - a bullet rips through Abra\\'s arm.  Petruchio dives for cover; Gregory and Sampson leap into Benvolio\\'s truck.  Rubber burns as they smash past the Capulet vehicle.  CLOSE ON: Tybalt taking aim.  EXT.  HIGHWAY - SUPERMARKET.  AFTERNOON.  His first shot plugs the fuel tank, the second a tire.  Out of control and spewing gasoline the Montague truck careens across the highway and through the glass front of a supermarket.  Gregory and Sampson throw themselves from the truck moments before...  EXT.  SUPERMARKET.  AFTERNOON.  CLOSE ON: The gas tank erupts into an almighty fireball.  The screen fills with flame: the following images combust in front of us:  EXT.  HIGHWAY - SUPERMARKET - FROM AIR.  AFTERNOON.  NEWS CHOPPER P.O.V.: Citizens run in the streets.  Looters raid shops near the supermarket - security guards return fire.  INT.  RESTAURANT.  NIGHT.  A table of dark suited men and their wives.  CLOSE ON: The powerful 60 year old face of FULGENCIO CAPULET. Seated next to him is his much younger wife GLORIA.  SUDDENLY: Windows explode in a tidal wave of glass.  Diners take cover.  Capulet moves fearlessly toward the window.                           CAPULET                    (to a waiter)             Give me my long sword!  EXT.  STREET.  NIGHT.  CLOSE ON: The word MONTAGUE fills the screen.  PULL BACK: We see the word is the number plate of a large black limousine.  The limousine is stuck in the traffic snarl - bullets bounce off its bullet proof windshield.  INT.  MONTAGUE\\'S LIMOUSINE.  NIGHT.  TED MONTAGUE, a 60 year old red-faced bulldog of a man, bursts from the back of the limousine.                           MONTAGUE             What noise is this!  As Ted draws an enormous pearl handed revolver, CAROLINE, his conservatively dressed wife, tries to restrain him.                           CAROLINE             Thou shalt not stir one foot to             seek a foe!                           MONTAGUE                    (shrugging her off)             Hold me not, let me go!  EXT.  STREET.  NIGHT.  Crouched behind a truck, Benvolio shakily tries to re-load.  CLOSE ON: The barrel of Tybalt\\'s gun enters frame and presses into Benvolio\\'s forehead.  Tybalt whispers sweetly.                           TYBALT             Look upon thy death, Benvolio.  CLOSE ON: Tybalt\\'s finger on the trigger.  Benvolio screams a scream of mortal horror.  SUDDENLY Tybalt is blinded by a burning shaft of light.  A magnificently powerful helicopter gunship hovers above him. A command booms from the chopper\\'s public address system.                           CAPTAIN PRINCE                    (over PA)             Rebellious subjects, enemies to             peace,             Throw your mistempered weapons to             the ground.  INT.  CHOPPER.  NIGHT.  CLOSE ON: The steely gray eyes of CAPTAIN PRINCE, chief of the Verona Beach Police Department. He lifts the microphone and repeats the command.                           CAPTAIN PRINCE             Throw your mistempered weapons to             the ground!  EXT.  VERONA BEACH.  NIGHT.  Tybalt looks up to the chopper.  Patrol cars screech to a halt.  An almighty orchestral chord.  EXT.  VERONA BEACH - MATTE SHOT.  NIGHT.  SUPER WIDE SHOT: A trail of devastation winds up through grid-locked traffic to the burning supermarket.  In the distance looms an enormous statue of Christ flanked by two glass towers.  We push toward the towers.  One is neon-crowned MONTAGUE, the other, CAPULET.  We hear:                           VOICE OVER             Two households, both alike in             dignity.             In fair Verona, where we lay our             scene             From ancient grudge break to new             mutiny,             Where civil blood makes civil hands             unclean.             From forth the fatal loins of these             two foes             A pair of star crossed lovers take             their life.             Whose misadventured piteous             overthrows             Doth with their death bury their             parents strife.  A dark chord.  EXT.  VERONA BEACH SKYLINE.  NIGHT.  A swarm of helicopters thunder into frame.  We see compressed, time-lapsed, images of their journey.  SLAM INTO: A coat of arms that labels a large tower - the emblem reads; \"Verona Beach Police Department: In God We Trust\".  HOLD:  INT.  CAPTAIN PRINCE\\'S PRECINCT OFFICE.  NIGHT.  CLOSE ON: Captain Prince\\'s grim features.  He eyes Capulet and Montague.                           CAPTAIN PRINCE             Three civil brawls, bred of an airy              word             By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,             Have thrice disturbed the quiet of             our streets.  Capulet\\'s lawyer tries to intervene.                           LAWYER             My noble Prince I can...  Captain Prince overriding, slams the desk.                           CAPTAIN PRINCE             If ever you disturb our streets             again,             Your lives shall pay the forfeit of             the peace.  Hold on Captain Prince\\'s determined gaze.  EXT.  VERONA STREET.  DAWN.  A majestic sunrise; Ted Montague\\'s limousine sulks through deserted streets.  In the distance, Jesus looks out over the now peaceful city.  INT.  MONTAGUE\\'S LIMOUSINE.  DAWN.  Ted Montague, his wife Caroline, and nephew Benvolio ride in uncomfortable silence.  Caroline finally speaks her anger.                           CAROLINE             O where is Romeo?  Saw you him             today?                    (pointedly to Montague)             Right glad I am he was not at this             fray.  Montague snorts derisively and stares out the window. Embarrassed, Benvolio tries to be of assistance.                           BENVOLIO             Madam, underneath The Grove of             Sycamore             So early walking did I see your son.  Ted Montague speaks with contempt.                           MONTAGUE             Many a morning hath he there been             seen             With tears augmenting the fresh             morning\\'s dew.  Caroline struggles to contain her emotion.                           CAROLINE             Away from light steals home my             heavy son             And private in his chamber pens             himself,             Shuts up his windows, locks fair             daylight out             And makes himself an artificial             night.  Montague barks into the car intercom.                           MONTAGUE             Westward from this city side.  EXT.  STREET.  DAWN.  The limousine U-turns heading west.  EXT.  BEACH.  DAWN.  To the melancholic strains of Mozart\\'s \"Serenade for Winds\", we see a blond nineteen year old boy sitting alone on an empty beach.  CLOSE ON: The boy, ROMEO.  Looking out over the ocean he sucks on the last of a cigarette and then writes intensely in a small worn note book.  We hear his voice over.                           ROMEO (V/O)             Love is a smoke made with the fume             of sighs;             Being purged, a fire sparkling in             lovers\\' eyes;             Being vexed, a sea nourished with             lovers\\' tears.             What is it else?  A madness most             discreet,             A choking gall and a preserving             sweet.  INT.  MONTAGUE\\'S LIMOUSINE.  DAWN.  The limo is parked in a cross street that runs down to the beach.  Opposite the limo, young diehard clubbers, faded drag queens and street people, hang outside a dilapidated nightclub.  A broken neon sign reads: \"The Grove of Sick Amore.\"  Ted, Caroline and Benvolio sit watching the silhouette of Romeo on the beach.                           MONTAGUE             Black and portentous must this             humour prove             Unless good counsel may the cause             remove.  EXT.  BEACH.  DAWN.  P.O.V.: From the limousine.  Romeo rises and listlessly makes his way up the beach - seeing his father\\'s car he turns and heads for the path that hugs the beach front.  INT.  MONTAGUE\\'S LIMOUSINE.  DAWN.                           BENVOLIO             So please you step aside.             I\\'ll know his grievance or be much             denied.  Benvolio clambers out of the limo.  CLOSE ON: Montague, an encouraging smile.                           MONTAGUE             Come Madam.  Let\\'s away.  EXT.  STREET.  DAWN.  The limousine pulls away and Benvolio heads after Romeo.  He pauses.  A deck at the rear of \"Sick Amore\" sprawls onto the beach.  At the base of the deck, Benvolio can see Romeo squatting in discussion with an old drunk.  Benvolio approaches with a not very convincing casualness.                           BENVOLIO             Good morrow, cousin.  Romeo turns.  Sore, red, unfriendly eyes squint back at Benvolio.                           ROMEO             Is the day so young?                           BENVOLIO             But new struck, Coz.  Romeo rises, Benvolio follows.                           ROMEO             Ay me!  Sad hours seem long.  Romeo stops as if taking in Benvolio for the first time.                           ROMEO (CONT.)             Was that my father that went hence             so fast?                           BENVOLIO                    (guilty)             It was.  Benvolio chases Romeo down the path which divides the beach from a string of cheap souvenir shops and sleazy bars.                           BENVOLIO             What sadness lengthens Romeo\\'s hours?                           ROMEO             Not having that which having makes             them short.                           BENVOLIO             In love?                           ROMEO             Out.                           BENVOLIO             Of love?                           ROMEO             Out of her favor where I am in love.                           BENVOLIO             Alas that love, so gentle in his             view,             Should be so tyrannical and rough             in proof!                           ROMEO             Alas that love, whose view...  Romeo is halted by the sight of last night\\'s disturbance displayed on a small TV screen in an outdoor bar.                           ROMEO (CONT.)             What fray was here?  Benvolio starts to reply.                           ROMEO (CONT.)                    (angrily)             Yet tell me not, for I have heard             it all.             Here\\'s much to do with hate, but             more with love.  Romeo turns the corner away from the beach.  He strides along the sidewalk raging.                           ROMEO (CONT.)             Why then, O brawling love, O loving             hate,             O anything, of nothing first             create!             O heavy lightness, serious vanity,             Misshapen chaos of well-seeming             forms,             Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold             fire, sick health,             Still-waking sleep, that is not             what it is!  Romeo screams at a huge bouncer who lounges in the doorway of a sex club.                           ROMEO (CONT.)             This love feel I, that feel no love             in this!  The bouncer\\'s hand moves to his gun.  Romeo, ignoring him, turns on Benvolio.  A mocking laughter through tears:                           ROMEO (CONT.)             Dost thou not laugh?  Benvolio, nervously eyeing the bouncer, shepherds Romeo out of danger.                           BENVOLIO             No, coz, I rather weep.  Romeo smiles.                           ROMEO             Farewell, my coz.  Romeo, breaking into a jog, leaves Benvolio behind.  Benvolio pursues him down the street.  EXT.  ROMEO\\'S CAR.  DAY.  CLOSE ON: The sleeping face of a fourteen year old boy - BALTHASAR.  PULL BACK: Balthasar sleeps on the hood of a magnificent silver car.  Three or four kids doze on the sidewalk.  As Romeo approaches, they jump up and begin vigorously polishing the already gleaming car.  Balthasar wakes.  He springs off the hood, chases the kids away, then, producing a huge bunch of keys, opens the car door for Romeo.  Benvolio intercepts Romeo at the car.                           BENVOLIO             Tell me in sadness, who is it that             you love.                           ROMEO             In sadness, cousin, I do love...a             woman.                           BENVOLIO             I aimed so near when I supposed you             loved.  Romeo leans against the car.                           ROMEO             A right good marksman; and she\\'s             fair I love.  Romeo pulls his shirt down to reveal a small shoulder tattoo.  CLOSE ON:  The tattooed word; ROSALINE.                           BENVOLIO             Rosaline!                    (he is impressed)             A right fair mark, fair coz, is             soonest hit.                           ROMEO             She\\'ll not be hit with Cupid\\'s             arrow.             She hath Dian\\'s wit,             And in strong proof of chastity             lives well armed.  Benvolio can\\'t believe it.                           BENVOLIO             Then she hath sworn that she will             still live chaste?                           ROMEO             She hath; and in that sparing makes             huge waste.  Benvolio - a plan.                          BENVOLIO             Be ruled by me; forget to think of             her.                           ROMEO             O, teach me how I should forget to             think!  Benvolio indicates one of the working girls already strutting the foot path.                           BENVOLIO             By giving liberty unto thine eyes.             Examine other beauties.  Romeo laughs dismissively.  He throws the kids a few coins and slides into the drivers seat.  Balthasar jumps in back.                           ROMEO             Farewell.  Thou canst not teach me             to forget.                           BENVOLIO             I\\'ll pay that doctrine, or else die             in debt.  Benvolio leaps into the passenger seat of the moving vehicle.  INT.  CAPULET OFFICE.  DAY.  An orchestral fanfare.  TRACK DOWN: Past monstrous letters that read CAPULET and in through a window to discover Fulgencio Capulet.  He stares out the window toward the other tallest building in Verona; the one crested with the word MONTAGUE.                           CAPULET             But Montague is bound as well as I,             In penalty alike;  Capulet turns: on the other side of his desk sits DAVID PARIS; a square-jawed young man in a red cashmere sweater. Tea has been served from an exquisite silver tea service.                           CAPULET (CONT.)             And \\'tis not hard, I think, for me             so old as we to keep the peace.  Dave smiles obligingly.                           DAVE             Of honorable reckoning are you             both,             And pity \\'tis you lived at odds so             long.  An awkward pause: Dave sips tea, then, with a deep breath...                           DAVE (CONT.)             But now, my lord, what say you to             my suit?  Capulet considers the framed photograph on his desk.                           CAPULET             But saying o\\'er what I have said             before;             My child is yet a stranger in the             world;             Let two more summers wither in             their pride,             Ere we may think her ripe to be a             bride.  Dave is politely insistent.                           DAVE             Younger than she are happy mothers             made.                           CAPULET                    (checking him hard)             And too soon marred are those so             early made.             Earth hath swallowed all my hopes             but she;             She is the hopeful lady of my earth.  Capulet rounds the desk and places a fatherly hand on Dave\\'s shoulder.                           CAPULET (CONT.)             But woo her, gentle Paris, get her             heart.             My will to her consent is but a             part,             And she agreed, within her scope of             choice             Lies my consent and fair according             voice.             This night I hold an old Accustomed             feast.  Capulet leans close.                           CAPULET (CONT.)             At my poor house, look to behold             this night,             Fresh female buds that make dark             heaven light.             Hear all; all see,             And like her most whose merit most             shall be.  Capulet smiles knowingly.  Dave seems encouraged.                           CAPULET (CONT.)                    (a hearty slap)             Come go with me!  Capulet excitedly ushers Dave from the office.  INT.  POOL HALL.  DAY.  Dim, smoke filled.  Benvolio and Romeo play pool.                           BENVOLIO                    (chalking his cue)             Take thou some new infection to thy             eye.  He lines up the six ball top pocket.                           BENVOLIO (CONT.)             And the rank poison of the old will             die.  A hopeless shot that slams the eight ball toward the side pocket.  Romeo stops it with his hand and hurls it against the other balls.                           BENVOLIO             Why, Romeo, art thou mad?  Romeo sinks the other balls with his hands.                           ROMEO             Not mad, but bound more than a             madman is;             Shut up in prison, kept without my             food,  Romeo stalks away from the table.                           ROMEO (CONT.)             Whipped and tormented.  He stops at the gun check, rummaging in his pocket.                           ROMEO             Good day, good fellow.  A crusty old man looks up from the small television.  His entire face a tattooed shooting target, the bullseye between his eyes.  The old man points to the sign that reads: \"No ticket no gun.\"  Romeo finally produces a ticket.  Crusty the Target goes out back.  Romeo\\'s attention is caught by the television.  INT.  T.V.  STUDIO SET.  DAY  CUT TO: TELEVISION.  An ostentatious woman and her over groomed partner Rich, hosts what looks to be a kind of Entertainment Tonight show. The graphic behind them reads \"Solemnity Nights\" with Susan Santandiago and Rich Ranchidis.  Susan speaks conspiratorially to camera.                           SUSAN             Now I\\'ll tell you without asking.             The great             Rich Capulet, holds an old             accustomed feast;  Rich chimes in:                           RICH             A fair Assembly.                           SUSAN             I Pray you sir can you read?  A list of names begins to scroll across the screen.  Rich reads them off.                           RICH             Signor Placentio and his wife and             daughters,             Signor Martino, the Lady Widow             Of Utruvio and her lovely nieces,             Rosaline and Livia...  INT.  POOL HALL.  DAY.  CUT TO: Benvolio, he leans into Romeo.                           BENVOLIO             At this same ancient feast of             Capulet\\'s             Sups the fair Rosaline; whom thou             so loves,             With all the admired beauties of             Verona.             Go thither, and with unattained eye             Compare her face with some that I             shall show,             And I will make thee think thy swan             a crow.                           ROMEO             One fairer than my love?  Crusty returns.  He hands the boys their guns.                           ROMEO (CONT.)             The all-seeing sun Ne\\'er saw her             match since first the world begun.  CUT TO: TELEVISION.                           SUSAN             If you be not of the house of             Montagues,             Come and crush a cup of wine!                           RICH             Rest you merry!  CUT TO: Romeo, he considers.                           ROMEO             I\\'ll go along, no such sight to be             shown.             But to rejoice in splendour of mine             own.  The boys move off.  PUSH IN ON: THE TELEVISION.  EXT.  CAPULET STATE.  DAY.  An aerial shot of a magnificent island estate.  An Italianate wonder of Florentine architecture.  Armed guards patrol the grounds.  The telecaption reads \"Capulet Mansion.\"  The file tape loses its television quality.  We sweep down through manicured gardens, where workers prepare decorations for tonight\\'s celebrations, and into the house.  The music darkens and we hear the desperate calling of a girl\\'s name.                           VOICE OVER             J U L I E T !  INT.  CAPULET MANSION - CORRIDOR.  DAY.  CUT TO: A long deserted corridor.                           VOICE OVER             J U L I E T !  INT.  CAPULET MANSION - DRAWING ROOM.  DAY.  CUT TO: An echoey Chinoiserie style drawing room.                           VOICE OVER             J U L I E T !  INT.  BATHROOM.  DAY.  CLOSE ON: The still, serene, submerged features of a beautiful young girl.  Dark floating hair gently frames the face.  Heavy liquid eyes stare up through the water.  We hear, though faintly, the calling:                           VOICE OVER             J U L I E T !  With a rush JULIET surfaces.  As she gulps air, we realise that she is in fact, in a bath.  We hear the calling loudly again.                           VOICE OVER             J U L I E T !  Juliet listens.  For a moment she is very still, then she closes her eyes and slides back beneath the surface of the water.  INT.  ENTRANCE HALL CAPULET MANSION.  DAY.  A Gothic, unfriendly environment heavy with religious iconography.  The entrance hall is crowded with workers and servants preparing for tonight\\'s party.  Gloria Capulet fiddles with a short black wig in the hallway mirror.  She is attired in full Cleopatra costume.  Dissatisfied with the wig, she rips it from her head and calls maniacally.                           GLORIA             J U L I E T !  Gloria is met by the NURSE, a fat, grandmotherly Hispanic woman.                           GLORIA (CONT.)             Nurse, where\\'s my daughter?  Call             her forth to me.                           NURSE             I bade her come.  God forbid!             Where\\'s this girl?             Juliet!  CUT TO: The top of the stairs.  As if from nowhere, Juliet has appeared.  She wears a bathrobe and her hair is wet.                           JULIET                    (coolly)             Madam, I am here.  What is you will.  Gloria, startled, sweeps up the stairs and shuffles her daughter toward a doorway.                           GLORIA             Nurse, give leave awhile, we must             talk in secret.  INT.  GLORIA\\'S DRESSING ROOM.  DAY.  Gloria shepherds Juliet into her opulent dressing room and closes the door.  She circles with nervous vexation searching for words, stops, then suddenly opens the door and yells out to the Nurse.                           GLORIA (CONT.)             Nurse, come back again.             I have remembered me, thou\\'s hear             our counsel.  The Nurse enters.  Gloria, still refusing eye contact, checks her appearance once more in the mirror.  She takes a hairbrush and, feigning pleasantness, intensely brushes her hair.                           GLORIA (CONT.)             Nurse, thou knowest my daughter\\'s             of a pretty age.                           NURSE                    (to Juliet)             Thou wast the prettiest babe that             e\\'er I nursed.  The hair brush clatters onto the dresser.  A moment of tense silence.  Gloria grips herself and pours a sherry.  Back still turned, she speaks to her daughter.                           GLORIA             By my count, I was your mother much             upon these years             That you are now a maid.  A nembutal twists like a pin in the corner of Gloria\\'s mouth. She slugs it down with the sherry and turns abruptly to face Juliet.                           GLORIA (CONT.)             Thus then in brief, the valiant             Paris seeks you for his love.  CUT TO: Juliet; an uncomprehending stare.  The Nurse, caught off guard, tries to buoy the situation.                           NURSE             A man, young lady!  Lady, such a             man             As all the world - why, he\\'s a man             of wax.  The medication takes immediate effect upon Gloria.  She joins Juliet on the couch and coos in Paris\\'s favour.                           GLORIA             Verona\\'s summer hath not such a             flower.                           NURSE             Nay, he\\'s a flower; in faith, a             very flower.                           GLORIA             This night you shall behold him at             our feast;             Read o\\'er the volume of young             Paris\\' face             And find delight writ there with             beauty\\'s pen.             This precious book of love, this             unbound lover,             To beautify him only lacks a cover.             So shall you share all that he doth             possess,             By having him, making yourself no             less.  Gloria probes Juliet\\'s thoughts.                           GLORIA             Can you like of Paris\\' love?  Juliet, adept at negotiating her mother\\'s strange moods, chooses her words precisely.                           JULIET             I\\'ll look to like, if looking             liking move,             But no more deep will I endart mine             eye,             Than your consent gives strength to             make it fly.  PETER the chauffeur enters.                           PETER             Madam.  The guests are come.                           GLORIA                    (checks the mirror)             We follow thee.  She exits, Nurse in tow.  CLOSE ON: Juliet stares out the windows and across the water.  Suddenly the Nurse\\'s face leers into shot.  She whispers enthusiastically into Juliet\\'s ear.                           NURSE             Go girl, seek happy nights to happy             days.  CLOSE ON: Juliet\\'s face.  EXT.  CAPULET MANSION.  DAY/NIGHT.  JUMP CUT: Aerial shot of Capulet Mansion.  We time lapse from late afternoon to night; fairy lights illuminate, guests appear, music swells, and a single incandescent flare, explodes pink against the inky sky.  EXT.  BEACH.  NIGHT.  CLOSE ON: Romeo: his face glows pink.  He is sitting on the grubby shoreline of Verona Bay dressed as a boy King Arthur, with fake chain mail and sword.  Romeo watches the dying flare sink into the bay.  The sound of the party drifts across the water.  Balthasar, dressed as Frankenstein\\'s monster, touches a lighter to a large bong and Romeo inhales smoke.  Behind them, Benvolio, drunk and dressed as a pizza, is yelling at Gregory, who, dressed as a Viking, is trying to cut slices off his pizza costume.  Sampson, also dressed as a Viking, sits in the back of a car.  One arm is bandaged and he swigs from a bottle.  Suddenly the darkness is slashed by headlights.  A reckless sports car speeds toward the boys.  Stereo screaming, the car skids to a halt.  CLOSE ON: Music blares from the sound system.  A silver stilettoed foot emerges from the car and plants itself firmly in the dirt.  CUT TO: The boys, eyes wide with amazement.  CUT TO: Another stiletto follows the first.  Guitar groans.  PAN: Slowly up a shapely pair of black stockinged legs, past a hint of garter belt to a black sequined mini-skirt and up over a muscular dark skinned stomach and tiny sequined bra top, to discover: the 21 year old male, African American face of MERCUTIO.  CUT TO: The boys.  Recovering from the initial shock, they laugh and cat-call raucously.  CUT TO: Mercutio.  He roughly jams a short black wig onto his head and yells above the music.                           MERCUTIO             Strike drum!  Mercutio magically produces invitations from somewhere within his mini-skirt and dances down the beach to the boys.  Aggressively bumping and grinding, Mercutio distributes the invitations.  Reaching Romeo, he declares:                           MERCUTIO             We\\'ll on without apology.  Romeo lets the invitation fall to the sand.                           ROMEO             I am not for this ambling.             Being but heavy, I will bear the             light.  Romeo pulls on the bong once more.  Suddenly, Mercutio is upon Romeo.  Hauling him to his feet, he waltzes him through the sand.                           MERCUTIO             Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you             dance.  Romeo pushes Mercutio away.                           ROMEO             Not I, believe me.  You have             dancing shoes             With nimble soles.  I have a soul             of lead.  Mercutio in mock sympathy.                           MERCUTIO             Too great oppression for a tender             thing.                           ROMEO             Is love a tender thing?  It is too             rough, too rude, too boisterous,             and it pricks like thorn.  Romeo lies staring up at the stars.                           MERCUTIO             If love be rough with you, be rough             with love.  Mercutio jumps on Romeo.                           MERCUTIO (CONT.)             Prick love for pricking, and you             beat love down.  Romeo fights Mercutio off.                           ROMEO             Under love\\'s heavy burden do I sink!  CUT TO: Benvolio, impatiently honking the horn.                           BENVOLIO             Every man betake him to his legs!  Mercutio heads Romeo toward the car.                           MERCUTIO             Come, we burn daylight, ho!  Romeo pulls away.                           ROMEO             But \\'tis no wit to go.  Mercutio turns, exasperated.                           MERCUTIO             Why, may one ask?                           ROMEO             I dreamt a dream tonight.                           MERCUTIO             And so did I.                           ROMEO             Well, what was yours?                           MERCUTIO             That dreamers often lie.                           ROMEO             In bed asleep, while they do dream             things true.  Mercutio produces a tiny gold pill case.                           MERCUTIO             O, then I see Queen Mab hath been             with you.             She is the fairies\\' midwife, and             she comes             In shape no bigger than an agate             stone             On the forefinger of an alderman,             Drawn with a team of little atomies             Over men\\'s noses as they lie asleep.  Tantalisingly, he passes the case beneath Romeo\\'s nose.                           MERCUTIO (CONT.)             Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,             Her wagoner a small gray-coated gnat.  With a conjurer\\'s dexterity Mercutio extracts a small, gray pill.                           MERCUTIO (CONT.)             And in this state she gallops night             by night             Through lovers\\' brains, and then             they dream of love;  He palms the pills.  It reappears from behind Romeo\\'s ear.                           MERCUTIO (CONT.)             O\\'er lawyers\\' fingers who straight             dream on fees;             O\\'er ladies\\' lips, who straight on             kisses dream,             Which oft the angry Mab with             blisters plagues.             Because their breaths with             sweetmeats tainted are.  The pill box glints in the moonlight.                           MERCUTIO (CONT.)             Sometime she driveth o\\'er a             soldier\\'s neck;             And then dreams he of cutting             foreign throats.             And being thus frighted, swears a             prayer or two             And sleeps again.  Mercutio now intensely angry:                           MERCUTIO (CONT.)             This is that very Mab             That plaits the manes of horses in             the night             And bakes the elf-locks in foul             sluttish hairs  He screams into the night.                           MERCUTIO (CONT.)             This is the hag, when maids lie on             their backs,             That presses them and learns them             first to bear,             Making them women of good carriage.             This is she, this is she...  CLOSE ON: Mercutio.  He breaks off.  There is a strange stillness amongst the group.  Romeo goes to his friend.                           ROMEO             Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace.             Thou talkest of nothing.  Mercutio meets Romeo\\'s gaze.                           MERCUTIO             True, I talk of dreams;             Which are the children of an idle             brain,             Begot of nothing but vain fantasy.             Which is as thin of substance as             the air             And more inconstant than the wind,             who woos             Even now the frozen bosom of the             north             And, being angered, puffs away from             thence             Turning his attention to the dew-             dropping south.  CUT TO: Benvolio in the car.  The alcohol has caught up with him and he looks a little queasy.                           BENVOLIO             This wind you talk of blows us from             ourselves:             Supper is done and we shall come             too late.  Romeo looks toward the distant city.                           ROMEO             I fear, too early, for my mind             misgives             Some consequence yet hanging in the             stars             Shall bitterly begin his fearful             date             With this night\\'s revels, and             expire the term             Of a despised life closed in my             breast,             By some vile forfeit of untimely             death.  PAUSE: The water turns golden as fireworks explode across the bay.  Romeo smiles.                           ROMEO (CONT.)             But he that hath the steerage of my             course             Direct my sail!  He takes the pill and drops it into his mouth.                           ROMEO (CONT.)             On, lusty gentlemen!  With the rush of a mind altering cocktail, we ZOOM IN on Romeo\\'s eyes; they shimmer with the shooting star reflection of exploding fireworks - a bending Eastern chord, we launch into Donna Summer\\'s \\'I Feel Love\\', sung by the vocalist from Soundgarden with orchestration by \\'Deconstruction\\' and sitar by Ravi Shankar.  EXT.  MERCUTIO\\'S CAR - ON FREEWAY.  NIGHT.  PULL OUT: From Romeo\\'s eyes.  He is lying in the passenger seat of Mercutio\\'s convertible as it rockets along the freeway.  The camera is directly above Romeo.  He stares up at the fireworks that reflect in the windshield.  The car and freeway begin to rotate and the camera follows.  We feel that the car is now travelling upside-down.  The camera sways through a brilliant explosion of fireworks that fill the screen with a zillion pixilating, colored dots of fire.  INT.  CAPULET\\'S MANSION - BALLROOM.  NIGHT.  PULL OUT: To discover the glittering dots of fire refracting from the sparkling domed roof of the magnificently ornate Capulet Ballroom.  The camera swoops down over bizarrely costumed revellers cavorting to a driving Latin big band. The camera partners with a drugged Mercutio and Benvolio who shamelessly caper with each other in a mock antic adagio.  CUT TO: Romeo gazing blankly at the dance floor.  CUT TO: Mercutio.  He sweeps up a thirty-something sophisticate and twirls her in Romeo\\'s direction.                           MERCUTIO             Everyman betake him to his legs!  Romeo moves off through the crowd.  CUT TO: ROMEO\\'S P.O.V.: Contorted images of costumed guests eat, drink and laugh in a grotesque collision of Yves Saint Laurent cocktail party and Bacchanalian romp.  Suddenly a large arm coils around Romeo\\'s neck.  DISTORTED EXTREME CLOSE UP: A seriously intoxicated Fulgencio Capulet; his puffy red face squeezes against Romeo\\'s.                           CAPULET             Ah, I have seen the day that I             could             Tell a whispering tale in a fair             ladies ear.             Such as would please.  Capulet screams above the music:                           CAPULET (CONT.)             Come musicians play!  Blood drums in Romeo\\'s ears.  Breaking free from Capulet\\'s grasp as he pushes through the crowd toward the bathroom.  INT.  BATHROOM.  NIGHT.  Silent, underwater shot.  Romeo\\'s tranquil features submerged in a basin of water.  BEAT.  With a gasp, Romeo rises.  A moment.  His breathing calms. Then, smoothing water into his hair, he gazes into the bathroom mirror.  He turns:  The entire wall opposite the mirror, is a magnificent salt- water fish tank.  Romeo, drawn by it\\'s submarine beauty, leans against the fish tank.  Applause echoes faintly through the bathroom speakers.  INT.  BALLROOM.  NIGHT.  As the applause dies, a dark-haired Latina Diva takes the spotlight.  The band ease into the opening bars of a love ballad.  INT.  BATHROOM.  NIGHT.  As the music swells, Romeo watches a moustached catfish glide past a medieval castle.  Suddenly, Romeo pulls away.  Peering back at him through the castle is a pair of exquisitely beautiful angelic eyes.  The Diva\\'s first pure, achingly beautiful notes soar.  Confused, Romeo looks again.  There is no mistake - it is a girl.  Through a shimmering curtain of ribbon weed, two dark wide eyes, a childish nose and sumptuous full lips.  Romeo pushes his face closer to the glass.  The other face snaps abruptly away.  INT.  POWDER ROOM.  NIGHT.  CUT TO: Juliet, dressed as an angel, on the other side of the tank.  We now realise that the girls\\' powder room and the boys\\' bathroom are divided by this watery wonder world.  Juliet warily moves closer to the glass.  INT.  BATHROOM.  NIGHT.  Romeo leans his face against the glass.  The love ballad builds.  SLOW TRACK: From Romeo\\'s profile, in through the water, and...  INT.  POWDER ROOM.  NIGHT.  ...out the other side, to find Juliet in profile, peering into the tank.  INT.  BATHROOM.  NIGHT.  Romeo presses his nose lightly against the glass.  INT.  POWDER ROOM.  NIGHT.  Juliet; a tiny smile.  Suddenly, CRASH!  The door slams open.  Juliet turns, startled.  It is the Nurse.                           NURSE             Juliet, your mother calls.  The Nurse bustles Juliet out the door.  Juliet looks over her shoulder at the mystery boy.  INT.  BALLROOM.  NIGHT.  Romeo, now without his mask, slams out of the bathroom - Juliet and the Nurse have disappeared into the crowd.  CUT TO: Juliet being dragged along by the Nurse.  She glances back toward the mystery boy, but he is gone.  Juliet and the Nurse rejoin Dave Paris, who is dressed as an astronaut, and Gloria, at the side of the dance floor.  Dave, irresistible smile, extends his hand to Juliet.                           DAVE             Will you now deny to dance?  Juliet looks to Dave, desperately searching for a reason to decline.  Gloria, brushing aside her silly daughter\\'s protests, slugs the last of her champagne and corrals them onto the dance floor.                           GLORIA                    (whispering to Juliet)             A man, young lady, such a man.  As Juliet is dragged onto the floor her eyes furtively search for the boy.  CUT TO: Romeo in the crowd.  Desperate to find the girl, he roughly shunts aside a reveller dressed as Lucifer, Prince of Darkness.  HOLD ON: Lucifer.  He removes his mask: it is Tybalt.  He turns to Abra, who\\'s dressed as a demon.                           TYBALT             What, dares the slave come hither             to fleer and scorn at our solemnity?             Now by the stock and honor of my             kin             To strike him dead I hold it not a             sin.  Tybalt moves off aggressively, but is halted as Capulet slams a hand into his chest.                           CAPULET             Why how now kinsman, wherefore             storm you so?                           TYBALT             Uncle, this is that villain Romeo.             A Montague, our foe.  Capulet peers across the ballroom.                           CAPULET             Young Romeo is it?                           TYBALT             \\'Tis he.                           CAPULET             Content thee gentle coz, let him             alone.             I would not for the wealth of all             this town             Here in my house do him             disparagement.             Therefore be patient; take no note             of him.  Tybalt can\\'t believe it.                           TYBALT             I\\'ll not endure him.  CLOSE ON: Capulet, exploding with rage.                          CAPULET             He shall be endured!                    (slapping Tybalt viciously)             What, goodman boy!  I say he shall!             Go to.  Capulet violently shoves Tybalt to the ground.                           CAPULET             You\\'ll make a mutiny among my guests!  A middle aged couple look on shocked - Capulet waves to them festively:                           CAPULET             What?  Cheerly my hearts!  Capulet snorts at Tybalt in disgust.                           CAPULET             You\\'ll not endure him!  Am I the             master here or you?  Go to.  Smoothing his hair into place, Capulet turns back into the ballroom.  CLOSE ON: Tybalt choking back tears of rage.  CUT TO: Romeo moving through the crowd.  For a moment the crush clears and he spies the Angel on the dance floor.  CLOSE ON: Romeo whispers:                           ROMEO             Did my heart love till now?             Forswear it, sight.             For I ne\\'er saw true beauty till             this night.  Romeo begins to circumnavigate the dance floor in an attempt to get closer to Juliet.  CUT TO: Dave slow dancing with Juliet.  Juliet\\'s eyes search the room for the boy.  CLOSE ON: Romeo.  CLOSE ON: Juliet.  Their eyes connect.  Juliet looks quickly back to Dave who, oblivious, returns his most devastating smile.  CUT TO: The songstress, her voice soars.  CUT TO: Juliet.  Unable to look away from the boy, she stares over Dave\\'s shoulder.  CUT TO: Romeo.  Ignoring the danger, he continues to move toward the Angel.  With the Diva\\'s spiralling final notes, the ballad concludes.  A complete black out.  As the crowd break into wild applause, Juliet\\'s eyes search the darkness, but the boy is gone.  The crowd cheers and screams its applause.  An avalanche of balloons, tinsel and confetti rains down from the roof; swathes of red silk drop from the ceiling and the space is transformed.  CLOSE ON: Juliet, searching for the boy.  Suddenly: A gasp, Juliet\\'s eyes widen, shocked.  In the dark, a hand has shot out from the drape curtaining off the stage and clasped hers.  Juliet barely dares breathe.  She glances furtively to Dave Paris - he watches the stage.  Slowly Juliet turns toward the hand; there through a break in the curtain she can see eye, cheek and lips of the mystery boy.  As the Diva reprises the chorus, Romeo gently pulls Juliet behind the curtain.  INT.  BEHIND CURTAIN.  NIGHT.  Concealed from the party by the red velvet drape, hands still clasped, the teenagers are so close their bodies almost touch.                           ROMEO             If I profane with my unworthiest             hand             This holy shrine, the gentle sin is             this.             My lips, two blushing pilgrims,             ready stand             To smooth that rough touch with a             tender kiss.  Romeo moves his lips toward Juliet\\'s.  She stops him.                           JULIET             Good pilgrim, you do wrong your             hand too much,             Which mannerly devotion shows in             this.             For saints have hands that pilgrim\\'s             hands do touch,             And palm to palm is holy palmers\\'             kiss.                           ROMEO             Have not saints lips, and holy             palmers too?                           JULIET                    (a gentle scolding)             Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must             use in prayer.                           ROMEO             O, then, dear saint, let lips do             what hands do,             They pray: grant thou, lest faith             turn to despair.                           JULIET             Saints do not move, though grant             for prayer\\'s sake.                           ROMEO             Then move not while my prayer\\'s             effect I take.  He kisses her.                           ROMEO (CONT.)             Thus from my lips, by thine my sin             is purged.                           JULIET             Then have my lips the sin that they             have took.                           ROMEO             Sin from my lips?  O trespass             sweetly urged!             Give me my sin again.  He kisses her.                           JULIET             You kiss by th\\' book.  They kiss again.  Suddenly a harsh light falls across the entwined couple. They break apart - Nurse has pulled open the curtain and stands eyeing them severely.                           NURSE             Madam, your mother craves a word             with you.  We see that the party is breaking up.  But for groups of die-hard revellers, the room is nearly empty.                           NURSE (CONT.)             Come, let\\'s away.  She takes firm control of her charge.  Juliet furtively motions for the startled Romeo not to follow as he trails them across the room.  CUT TO: ROMEO\\'S P.O.V.: The Nurse and Juliet reach the door, but instead of leaving, they turn and ascend the staircase that arcs around to the mezzanine level.  They join a vexed Gloria Capulet who clings to a patient Dave Paris.  Inaudible words are exchanged.  Juliet flickers her eyes nervously to Romeo.  CUT TO: Romeo.  He halts at the foot of the stairs unsure.  CUT TO: Gloria.  Catching Juliet\\'s interest in the boy, she indicates to her daughter to \\'COME ALONG\\'.  CUT TO: Romeo; a dawning realisation.                           ROMEO                    (under his breath)             Is she a Capulet?  CUT TO: Juliet.  She stops and turns back.  CUT TO: Romeo, comprehending the reality of who she is.  CUT TO: Juliet.  The Nurse whispers in her ear.                           NURSE             His name is Romeo, and a Montague,             The only son of your great enemy.  An orchestral treatment of Joy Division\\'s \"Love will tear us Apart\" swells;  HOLD ON: Juliet.  Like a cloud passing across the sun, a dark coldness descends upon her.  CUT TO: Mercutio.  He throws himself upon the shell shocked Romeo.                           MERCUTIO             Away, begone, the sport is at its             best.  Mercutio shuttles Romeo toward the door.                           ROMEO             Ay so I fear,  A covert glance over his shoulder.                           ROMEO (CONT.)             The more is my unrest.  EXT.  CAPULET MANSION.  NIGHT.  Mercutio bundles Romeo through the front door and down the stairs to the waiting getaway car.  INT.  CAPULET MANSION - STAIRS ALCOVE WINDOW - NIGHT.  CUT TO: Juliet.  Manoeuvred by the Nurse up the stairs, she breaks away and rushes to a tiny, windowed alcove.  EXT.  CAPULET MANSION - MAIN ENTRANCE.  NIGHT.  CUT TO: Mercutio\\'s convertible and its noisy confederacy joining the line of departing limos.  A huge sign combusts into blinding fireworks that write in giant words \"CAPULET.\"  As the convertible passes beneath the blazing words, Romeo turns.  Through a deluge of falling sparks, he glimpses the mystery girl high up in the tower.  EXT.  CAPULET MANSION - WINDOW.  NIGHT.  CLOSE ON: Juliet leaning out of the tower window.  Brilliant sparkles light in her eyes.  PUSH IN: We hear her secret whisper:                           JULIET             My only love, sprung from my only             hate.             Too early seen unknown, and known             too late.             Prodigious birth of love it is to me  EXT.  CAPULET MANSION - MAIN ENTRANCE DRIVE.  NIGHT.  CUT TO: JULIET\\'S P.O.V.: In slow motion Romeo, through the falling curtain of fiery embers.                           JULIET (CONT.)(V/O)             That I must love a loathed enemy.  EXT.  CAPULET MANSION - WINDOW.  NIGHT.  Warm wind blows the smoke from the expended fireworks. Juliet closes the window and leans against the glass.  CRANE DOWN: The side of the building past revellers who don\\'t know when to leave.  Standing in the front doorway is someone else who cannot take their eyes off the departing Romeo.  It is Tybalt.  The music darkens as we push through the smoky wind.                           TYBALT             I will withdraw.  But this intrusion             shall,             Now seeming sweet, convert to             bitterest gall.  INT.  MERCUTIO\\'S CAR.  NIGHT.  Caught in the jam of departing vehicles, Mercutio\\'s car crawls along the bridge that links Capulet island with the mainland.  The boys sing along raucously with the radio.                           BOYS             \"I am a pretty piece of flesh,             I am a pretty piece of flesh...\"  PUSH IN: On Romeo, he whispers:                           ROMEO             Can I go forward when my heart is             here?             Turn back, dull earth, and find thy             centre out.  Romeo leaps from the car.  Benvolio yells after him.                           BENVOLIO             Romeo!  Cousin Romeo!  Romeo!  EXT.  CAPULET BRIDGE.  NIGHT.  Romeo runs back along the bridge toward the estate.  At the gates, armed guards supervise the exodus of vehicles.  Romeo uses the traffic to shield himself from view.  Romeo leaps from the bridge and into the shadows at the base of the high stone wall that borders the compound.  EXT.  CAPULET BRIDGE.  NIGHT.  Mercutio\\'s car prowls back along the bridge.  The last guests have departed and the gates are swinging shut.  The convertible halts in front of them.                           BENVOLIO             He ran this way.  Call, good             Mercutio.                           MERCUTIO             Nay, I\\'ll conjure too.  Mercutio leaps from the car.  He postures like a magician in a low-budget variety special.  The boys cheer him on.                           MERCUTIO             Romeo!  Humours!  Madman!  Passion!             Lover!             I conjure thee by Rosaline\\'s bright             eyes,             By her high forehead and her             scarlet lip,             By her fine foot, straight leg, and             quivering thigh.             And the demesnes that there adjacent             lie,             That in thy likeness thou appear to             us!  EXT.  CAPULET WALL.  NIGHT.  CLOSE ON: Romeo\\'s fake chain mail shirt tangled in the barbed wire at the top of the wall.  PAN DOWN: Romeo, now on the other side of the wall, pulls up his undershirt and gingerly inspects the cuts inflicted by the wire.  Mercutio\\'s cavorting echoes from the bridge.  Romeo smiles ironically.                           ROMEO             He jests at scars that never felt a             wound.  Romeo moves off through the darkened grounds of Capulet estate.  EXT.  CAPULET BRIDGE.  NIGHT.  The boys laugh hysterically as Mercutio staggers around the bridge in imitation of a love sick fool.                           MERCUTIO             O Romeo, that she were, O that she             were             An open-arse and thou a poperin pear!  The hilarity is abruptly arrested as a security spotlight blazes to life, pinning Mercutio in its beam.  The sound of automatic weapons cocking pierces the night.  CLOSE ON: Mercutio.  He\\'s brave but not stupid.  He gets back into the car.                           MERCUTIO (CONT.)             Come, shall we go?  EXT.  THE BACK OF CAPULET MANSION.  NIGHT.  CLOSE ON: A pair of stone cherubs on top of the retaining wall of a terraced garden.  Romeo\\'s face appears between them.  Romeo hauls himself up onto the wall.  Below is a Greco- Roman style pool area.  To the right the darkened rear wing of Capulet Mansion.  Suddenly the back of the house explodes with light.  Romeo takes cover.                           ROMEO             But soft, what light through yonder             window breaks?  Romeo\\'s question is answered as out onto the verandah comes Juliet.  She is still clad in her angel robe, but without the halo and wings.  She slowly descends to pool level.                           ROMEO             It is the East, and Juliet is the             sun!             Arise, fair sun, and kill the             envious moon,             Who is already sick and pale with             grief             That thou her maid art far more             fair than she.             Be not her maid, since she is             envious.             Her vestal livery is but sick and             green,             And none but fools do wear it. Juliet stands on the top step of the pool stairs.  She is directly below Romeo as he whispers.                           ROMEO (CONT.)             Cast it off!  Juliet sits on the edge of the pool, her legs dangle in the water.                           ROMEO (CONT.)             It is my lady.  O, it is my love!             O that she knew she were!  Juliet sighs.                           JULIET             Ay me!                           ROMEO                    (whispers)             She speaks.             O, speak again, bright angel!  Juliet looks longingly toward the stars.                           JULIET             O Romeo, Romeo! - Whyfore art thou             Romeo?             Deny thy father and refuse thy             name.             Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn             my love,             And I\\'ll no longer be a Capulet.  CLOSE ON: Romeo.  Incredulous.                           ROMEO             Shall I hear more, or shall I speak             at this?                           JULIET             \\'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.             Thou are thyself, though not a             Montague.             What\\'s Montague?  It is not hand             nor foot             Nor arm nor face nor any other part             Belonging to a man.  O, be some             other name!             What\\'s in a name?             That which we call a rose             By any other word would smell as             sweet.             So Romeo would, were he not Romeo             called,             Retain that dear perfection which             he owes             Without that title.  Romeo, doff             thy name,             And for thy name, which is no part             of thee,             Take all myself.  Romeo wildly calls:                           ROMEO             I take thee at thy word!             Call me but love, and I\\'ll be new             baptised.             Henceforth I never will be Romeo.  Romeo jumps down from the wall.  Juliet screams, and turns, toppling backwards.  Romeo grabs her hand but her momentum overbalances him and they both plunge headlong into the pool.  EXT.  CAPULET MANSION - POOL - UNDERWATER.  NIGHT.  Underwater shot:  A slow motion phosphorescent tangle of arms, legs and bodies.  EXT.  CAPULET MANSION - BACK GARDEN.  NIGHT.  CUT TO: A security guard.  Alerted by the noise he moves toward the pool area.  EXT.  CAPULET MANSION - POOL GARDEN - NIGHT.  CUT TO: Above water, real time: Romeo and Juliet surface spluttering.  Juliet thrashes the water in an attempt to get distance from her attacker.                           JULIET             What man art thou that, thus             bescreened in night,             So stumblest on my counsel?  Romeo: A calming gesture as he tries to tread water.                           ROMEO             By a name I know not how to tell             thee who I am:             My name, dear saint, is hateful to             myself             Because it is an enemy to thee. The ferocious barking of a guard dog arrests the teenagers attention.  A moment, then they slide beneath the water.  CUT TO: The security guard and dog appearing above the pool area.  GUARD\\'S P.O.V.: The rippling surface of the water.  CUT TO - UNDERWATER SHOT: Romeo and Juliet submerged, hair streaming, stare at each other like two beautiful fish.  CUT TO: The guard.  He can see noisy caterers cleaning up around the other side of the house.  Frowning, he returns the way he came.  CUT TO: Romeo and Juliet.  Gasping for air, they cautiously surface.  A moment - then Juliet, a small smile.                           JULIET             Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?                           ROMEO             Neither, fair maid, if either thee             dislike.  Juliet looks nervously toward the house.  She drags Romeo toward a small grotto at the end of the pool.                           JULIET             How cam\\'st thou hither, tell me,             and whyfore?             The garden walls are high and hard             to climb,             And the place death, considering             who thou art.                           ROMEO                    (with splashy bravado)             With love\\'s light wings did I o\\'er             perch these walls.             For stony limits cannot hold love             out,             And what love can do, that dares             love attempt.             Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop             to me.  Juliet drags Romeo firmly into the grotto.                           JULIET                    (a real fear)             If they do see thee, they will             murder thee.  Romeo slowly pulls Juliet toward him.                           ROMEO             I have night\\'s cloak to hide me             from their eyes.             And but thou love me, let them find             me here.             My life were better ended by their             hate             Than death prorogued, wanting of             thy love.  The lovers kiss long and deep.  Then Juliet, suddenly fearful, pushes Romeo away.                           JULIET             Thou knowest the mask of night is             on my face,             Else would a maiden blush bepaint             my cheek,             For that which thou hast heard me             speak tonight.             Fain would I dwell on form - fain,             fain deny             What I have spoke.  But farewell             compliment!             Dost thou love me?  Romeo tries to speak, Juliet silences him.                           JULIET (CONT.)             I know thou wilt say \\'Ay\\', and I             will take thy word.  Yet, if thou             swearest,             Thou mayst prove false.  O gentle             Romeo,             If thou dost love, pronounce it             faithfully.             Or if thou think\\'st I am too             quickly won,             I\\'ll frown, and be perverse, and             say thee nay,             So thou wilt woo.  But else, not             for the world.             In truth, fair Montague, I am too             fond,             And therefore thou mayst think my             \\'haviour light.             But trust me, gentleman, I\\'ll prove             more true             Than those that have more cunning             to be strange.                           ROMEO             Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow,             That tips with silver all these             fruit-tree tops -                           JULIET             O, swear not by the moon, th\\'             inconstant moon,             That monthly changes in her circled             orb,             Lest that thy love prove likewise             variable.                           ROMEO             What shall I swear by?                           JULIET             Do not swear at all.             Or if thou wilt, swear by thy             gracious self,             Which is the god of my idolatry,             And I\\'ll believe thee.  She touches his cheek.  Romeo moves his lips close.                           ROMEO             If my heart\\'s dear love -  Confused, Juliet breaks away.                           JULIET             Well, do not swear.  Although I joy             in thee,             I have no joy of this contract             tonight.             It is too rash, too unadvised, too             sudden;             Too like the lightning, which doth             cease to be             Ere one can say \\'it lightens.\\'             Sweet, good night.             This bud of love, by summer\\'s             ripening breath,             May prove a beauteous flower when             next we meet.             Good night, good night.  As sweet             repose and rest             Come to thy heart as that within my             breast.  She rushes up the stairs - Romeo follows desperately.                           ROMEO             O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?  Juliet - a shocked look.                           JULIET             What satisfaction canst thou have             tonight?  CLOSE ON: Romeo.                           ROMEO             The exchange of thy love\\'s faithful             vow for mine.  CLOSE ON: Juliet.  She runs joyously to Romeo.                           JULIET             I gave thee mind before thou didst             request it!  Kissing him passionately.                           JULIET (CONT.)             And yet I would it were to give             again.                           ROMEO             Wouldst thou withdraw it?  For what             purpose love?                           JULIET             But to be frank and give it thee             again.  They kiss again.  The Nurse calls from inside.                           NURSE (O/S)             Juliet!  Juliet looks to the house.                           JULIET                    (breathlessly)             Three words, dear Romeo, and good             night indeed.             If that thy bent of love be             honourable.             Thy purpose marriage, send me word             tomorrow,             By one that I\\'ll procure to come to             thee,             Where and what time thou wilt             perform the rite,             And all my fortunes at thy foot             I\\'ll lay             And follow thee my lord throughout             the world.                           NURSE (O/S)             Madam!                           JULIET             I come, anon - But if thou meanest             not well,             I do beseech thee...                           NURSE (O/S)             Madam!                           JULIET                    (to Nurse)             By and by I come!             To cease thy strife and leave me to             my grief.             Tomorrow will I send.  Romeo holds Juliet\\'s gaze.                           ROMEO             So thrive my soul.                           NURSE (O/S)             Madam!  Juliet breaks away.                           JULIET             A thousand times good night!  With a final kiss, Juliet runs inside.                           ROMEO             A thousand times the worse, to want             thy light.             Love goes toward love as schoolboys             from their books;             But love from love, toward school             with heavy looks.  Juliet re-appears at the upper balcony.                           JULIET             Romeo!  What o\\'clock tomorrow             Shall I send to thee?                           ROMEO             By the hour of nine.  Juliet unclasps a delicate silver necklace from around her neck.                           JULIET             I will not fail. \\'Tis twenty year             till then.             Goodnight, goodnight!  Parting is             such sweet sorrow.             That I shall say goodnight till it             be morrow.  She lets the necklace fall from her hand.  Romeo catches it and she is gone.                           ROMEO             Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace             in thy breast,             Would I were sleep and peace, so             sweet to rest.  INT.  GREENHOUSE.  DAWN.  Morning sunlight filters through the lush foliage of a tropical rainforest.  PAN DOWN: As we hear:                           FATHER LAURENCE (O/S)             O mickle is the powerful grace that             lies             In plants, herbs, stones, and their             true qualities.  We discover the intensely concentrating features of FATHER LAURENCE.  Fifties, wiry and wearing a priest\\'s collar, Laurence delicately makes an incision in the bulb of a small purple flowered plant.  A pair of fresh faced ten year old boys look on in wonderment as a vivid blue sap oozes from the incision.                           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)             Within the infant rind of this weak             flower             Poison hath residence, and medicine             power.  PULL BACK: The Priest carefully gathers the sap into a beaker.  We discover that we are in a small tropical greenhouse.                           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)                    (to the boys)             For this, being smelt, with that             part cheers each part;             Being tasted, stays all senses with             the heart. The boys follow the Father as he moves out of the greenhouse and into an adjoining work area.  The walls are lined with bottles of herbs and dried plants and a television flickers in the corner.                           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)             For naught so vile on the earth             doth live,             But to the earth some special good             doth give;  With the precision of a chemist, Father Laurence funnels the sap into a small bottle and places it in the refrigerator. From out of the refrigerator he produces a large jar of candy.  He eyes the boys sternly.                           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)             Nor aught so good but, strained             from that fair use,             Revolts from true birth, stumbling             on abuse.  The boys take their candy and scram.  CUT TO: The muted television.  A morning news program shows footage of a murder scene cordoned off with police tape.  A distraught mother is being restrained.  CLOSE ON: The priest contemplating the television.                           FATHER LAURENCE             Two such opposed kings encamp them             still             In man as well as herbs: grace and             rude will;             And where the worser is predominant,             Full soon the canker death eats up             that plant.  A feverish knocking breaks the priest\\'s reverie.                           ROMEO (O/S)             Good morrow, father!  Father Laurence snaps off the television and exits the workroom.  EXT.  WALL.  DAWN.  Romeo, dressed in last night\\'s chain mail, pounds desperately on a wooden door set into a high stone wall.                           ROMEO             Good morrow, father!  EXT.  COURTYARD.  DAWN.  From the workroom, Father Laurence enters a courtyard which encloses a tranquil tropical garden.  He opens a door in the wall of the courtyard and smiles as the costumed Romeo bursts in.                           FATHER LAURENCE             Benedicite!             What early tongue so sweet saluteth             me?  Without pausing, the priest continues through the courtyard and toward the church.                           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)             Young son, it argues a distempered             head             So soon to bid good morrow to thy             bed.             Or if not so, then here I hit it             right -             Our Romeo hath not been in bed             tonight.  The priest enters the back of the church.  INT.  SACRISTY.  DAWN.  Romeo, on fire to tell of his experience, follows the priest into the sacristy.                           ROMEO             The last is true.  The sweeter rest             was mine.                           FATHER LAURENCE                    (he stops)             God pardon sin!  Wast thou with             Rosaline?                           ROMEO             With Rosaline, my ghostly father?             No.             I have forgot that name and that             name\\'s woe.  The Father lays out the cut glass bottles and communion tray for mass.                           FATHER LAURENCE             That\\'s my good son!  But where hast             thou been then?  Unconsciously, Romeo helps the priest prepare.  It is clear he knows the routine by heart.                           ROMEO             I have been feasting with mine             enemy,             Where on a sudden one hath wounded             me.             That\\'s by me wounded.  Both our             remedies             Within they help and holy physic             lies.                           FATHER LAURENCE                    (buttoning a long                    black cassock)             Be plain, good son, and homely in             thy drift.             Riddling confession finds but             riddling shrift.                           ROMEO             Then plainly know my heart\\'s dear             love is set,             On the fair daughter of rich             Capulet.             We met, we wooed, and made exchange             of vow,             I\\'ll tell thee as we pass.  But             this I pray,             That thou consent to marry us today.  CUT TO: The Priest, thunderstruck.  The two kids, now dressed in red altar-boy robes, enter.                           ALTAR BOYS             Good morrow, Romeo.  The apoplectic priest waves the boys away.  They get the message and bolt.                           FATHER LAURENCE             Holy Saint Francis!  What a change             is here!             Is Rosaline, that thou didst love             so dear,             So soon foresaken?  Young men\\'s             love then lies             Not truly in their hearts, but in             their eyes.                           ROMEO             Thou chid\\'st me oft for loving             Rosaline.                           FATHER LAURENCE                    (very angry)             For doting, not for loving, pupil             mine.                           ROMEO             I pray thee chide me not.  Her I             love now             Doth grace for grace and love for             love allow.             The other did not so.                           FATHER LAURENCE             O, she knew well             Thy love did read by rote, that             could not spell.  The Father falls into a chair and considers.  He looks through the sacristy door to where a small children\\'s choir has assembled.  Their angelic voices soar into the purest of hymns.                           CHOIR             How can you just leave me standing             Alone in a world so cold,             Maybe I\\'m just too demanding,             Maybe I\\'m just like my father, too             bold,             Maybe you\\'re just like my mother,             She\\'s never satisfied.             Why do we scream at each other?             This is what it sounds like when             doves cry...  We recognise the hymn as \"When Doves Cry\" by Prince.  PUSH IN: On the Priest; moved, he looks to Romeo.                           FATHER LAURENCE             But come, young waverer, come, go             with me.             In one respect I\\'ll thy assistant             be.             For this alliance may so happy             prove             To turn your households\\' rancor to             pure love.  Romeo hurriedly assists the priest with his vestments.                           ROMEO             O, let us hence!  I stand on sudden             haste.  Father Laurence holds Romeo in his powerful gaze.                           FATHER LAURENCE             Wisely and slow.  They stumble that             run fast.  The procession is joined by the two little altar boys and the mass begins.  EXT.  VERONA BEACH.  DAY.  As the Angelic voices of the choir soar, we see a pay phone etched with hyper-real starkness against the white sand, green sea and blue sky.  A single leaning palm tree frames the image like a ridiculous tourist postcard.  Benvolio speaks on the pay phone.  Mercutio, torso naked but for his holstered Sports Rapier 9mm, drums his fingers on the side of the booth.                           MERCUTIO             Where the devil should this Romeo             be?             Came he not home tonight?                           BENVOLIO                    (slamming down the phone)             Not to his father\\'s.  I spoke with             his man.  Mercutio storms off down the beach.                           MERCUTIO             Why, that same pale hard-hearted             wench, that Rosaline,             Torments him so that he will sure             run mad.                           BENVOLIO                    (running to keep up)             Tybalt hath sent a letter to his             father\\'s house.                           MERCUTIO                    (halts abruptly)             A challenge, on my life.  CLOSE ON: Benvolio, unsure.                           BENVOLIO             Romeo will answer it?                           MERCUTIO             Any man that can write may answer a             letter.                           BENVOLIO             Nay, he will answer the letter\\'s             master, how he dares, being dared.  Mercutio clamps Benvolio into a headlock.                           MERCUTIO             Alas, poor Romeo, he is already             dead!             Stabbed with a white wench\\'s black             eye,  He whispers into Benvolio\\'s ear:                           MERCUTIO (CONT.)             Run through the ear with a love             song.                    (in disgust)             And is he a man to encounter Tybalt?                           BENVOLIO                    (struggling to break free)             Why, what is Tybalt?                           MERCUTIO                    (releasing him)             More than Prince of Cats, I can             tell you.             O, he\\'s the courageous captain of             compliments.             The very butcher of a silk button.  Lightening fast, Mercutio draws his gun.  He twirls it in an impressive display of gunmanship which ends with the barrel between the startled Benvolio\\'s eyes.                           MERCUTIO (CONT.)             A duellist, a duellist.  Romeo\\'s car pulls into the beach side parking lot.  Benvolio heads toward it.                           BENVOLIO             Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!  EXT.  BEACH - PARKING LOT.  DAY.  Romeo alights from his car and throws his keys to Balthasar who lounges outside the beach side hang.  Mercutio saunters up the beach with mock nonchalance.                           MERCUTIO             Signor Romeo, Bonjour.  There\\'s a             French salutation to your French             slop.  You gave us the counterfeit             fairly last night.                           ROMEO             Good morrow to you both.  What             counterfeit did I give you?                           MERCUTIO             The slip, sir, the slip.  Can you             not conceive?  Romeo smiles smugly.                           ROMEO             Pardon, good Mercutio.  My business             was great, and in such a case as             mine a man may strain courtesy.                           MERCUTIO                    (sarcastically)             A most courteous exposition.                           ROMEO             Nay I am the very pink of courtesy.                           MERCUTIO                    (camply)             Pink for flower?  The boys laugh.  Romeo feigns anger.                           ROMEO             I will bite thee on the ear for             that jest!  Mercutio, goading Romeo to follow, backs off down the beach.                           MERCUTIO             Come between us, good Benvolio!  My             wits faint.  Mercutio flicks sand at Romeo, then sprints off down the beach.  Romeo, laughing, gives chase.                           ROMEO             Switch and spurs, switch and spurs,             or I\\'ll cry a match.  EXT.  BEACH - SHORELINE.  DAY.  Romeo is gaining on Mercutio, who runs headlong into the sea. With a yell, Romeo dives in after him.  EXT.  BEACH - AT SEA.  DAY.  Mercutio splashes the laughing Romeo.                           MERCUTIO             Why, is not this better now than             groaning for love?  Romeo tries to dunk Mercutio.                           MERCUTIO (CONT.)             Now art thou sociable.  Mercutio, evading, heads for shore.                           MERCUTIO (CONT.)             Now art thou Romeo.  Now art thou...  EXT.  BEACH - SHORELINE.  DAY.  Romeo tackles Mercutio on the wet sand.  Mercutio falls suddenly serious.                           MERCUTIO (CONT.)                    (quietly)             What thou art, by art as well as by             nature.  A moment between the boys.  A shadow falls across them. Romeo looks up.                           ROMEO             Here\\'s goodly gear.  Standing above the boys is the Nurse.  She wears a ridiculous, all red, \"Jackie O\" style disguise of sunglasses, scarf and parasol.                           MERCUTIO                    (bemused)             God ye good e\\'en fair gentlewoman.  The nurse, ignoring Mercutio, speaks dramatically to Romeo.                           NURSE             I desire some confidence with you.  She turns and walks back to the parking lot where Peter the chauffer waits beside the limousine.  Benvolio and the other boys look on curiously.                           MERCUTIO             A bawd, a bawd, a bawd!  So ho!  But Romeo rises and to the amazement of Mercutio actually follows this woman.  Mercutio looks questioningly to Benvolio, who shrugs.                           BENVOLIO             She will endite him to some supper?  Even more strangely, Romeo gets into the limousine.                           MERCUTIO                    (taken by surprise)             Romeo, will you come to your             father\\'s?             We\\'ll to dinner thither.                           ROMEO                    (as he closes the door)             I will follow you.                           MERCUTIO             Farewell, ancient lady.  Farewell.  The car pulls away.  EXT.  STREET.  DAY.  The limousine drives through Verona Beach.  INT.  MOVING LIMOUSINE.  DAY.  CLOSE ON: Romeo jammed into the corner of the seat.  The Nurse\\'s face is pressed alarmingly close to his.  She speaks in cold deadly earnest.                           NURSE             If ye should lead her in a fool\\'s             paradise, as they say, it were a             very gross kind of behavior, as             they say.  For the gentlewoman is             young; and therefore, if you should             deal double with her, truly it were             an ill thing and very weak dealing.  BEAT: Romeo chooses his words carefully.                           ROMEO             Bid her to come to confession this             afternoon,             And there she shall at Friar             Laurence\\'s cell             Be shrived and                    (PUSH IN ON: Romeo)             married.  INT.  JULIET\\'S BEDROOM.  DAY.  CLOSE ON: Juliet\\'s face peering out her bedroom window.                           JULIET             O God she comes!  EXT.  CAPULETS MANSION - DRIVEWAY.  DAY.  PULL BACK: JULIET\\'S P.O.V.: The limousine pulls up at the front door, the Nurse alights.  Juliet bolts from the room.  INT.  LANDING.  DAY.  Juliet hurries down the stairs - the Nurse, a way ahead, disappears into a doorway.  INT.  STAIRWAY.  DAY.  Juliet races down a dark stairwell that leads to the bowels of the house.  INT.  KITCHEN.  DAY.  The kitchen, obviously the Nurse\\'s domain, is decorated with a mixture of religious iconography and travel posters.  Most of the posters depict a strange city of decadent, decaying, beauty.  Juliet bursts breathlessly into the room.                           JULIET             O honey nurse, what news?  The Nurse, buried up to her ample hips inside the refrigerator, does not turn around.  Juliet cries impatiently.                           JULIET             Nurse!  The nurse emerges from the ice box laden with food.  Moving to the counter she starts to make a sandwich.                           NURSE             I am aweary, give me leave awhile.             Fie, how my bones ache.  What a             jaunce have I.  Juliet under her breath.                           JULIET             I would thou hadst my bones and I             thy news.  Juliet goes to the nurse.                           JULIET             Nay come, I pray thee, speak: good;             good             Nurse, speak.  Sandwich made, the nurse shuffles over to a corner couch.                           NURSE             Jesu, what haste.  Can you not stay             awhile?             Can you not see I am out of breath?  Juliet cannot stand the suspense any longer.                           JULIET             How art thou out of breath when             thou hast breath             To say to me that thou art out of             breath!             Is the news good or bad?  Answer to             that.  The Nurse takes a big bite from her sandwich and answers through thoughtful chews.                           NURSE             Well, you have made a simple             choice.             You know not how to choose a man.             Romeo?  No, not he.             Though his face be better than any             man\\'s, yet his leg excels all men\\'s             and for a hand and a foot and a             body, though they be not to be             talked on, yet they are past             compare.             He\\'s not the flower of courtesy,             but I\\'ll warrant him as gentle as a             lamb.  Go thy ways, wench, serve             God.  What, have you dined at home?  Juliet is flabbergasted.                           JULIET             No, no.  But all this I did know             before.  What says he of our             marriage?  What of that                           NURSE             Lord how my head aches!  What a             head have I:             My back -  This is a game that Juliet knows well.  She moves behind the Nurse and begins massaging her back.                           NURSE (CONT.)             o\\' t\\'other side - ah, my back!             Beshrew your heart for sending me             about             To catch my death with jauncing up             and down.  With sublime self control, Juliet coo\\'s sweetly.                           JULIET             I\\'faith I am sorry that thou art             not well.             Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me,             what says my love?                           NURSE             Your love says like an honest             gentleman,             And a courteous, and a kind, and a             handsome,             And I warrant a virtuous - Where is             your mother?  Juliet cracks.                           JULIET             Where is my mother?  How oddly thou             repliest!             \\'Your love says, like an honest             gentleman, \"Where is your mother\"\\'!  The nurse sulks.                           NURSE             O God\\'s lady dear are you so hot?             Henceforth do your messages yourself.  Juliet\\'s frustration explodes.                           JULIET             Here\\'s such a coil!  COME WHAT SAYS             ROMEO?  PAUSE: The Nurse considers Juliet.                           NURSE             Have you got leave to go to             confession today?                           JULIET             I have.                           NURSE             Then hie you hence to Father             Laurence cell.             There stays a husband to make you a             wife!  Juliet, with a scream of joy, hugs the Nurse to her.  HOLD ON: Juliet\\'s ecstatic features.  INT.  CHURCH.  DAY.  TIGHT ON: FATHER LAURENCE:                           FATHER LAURENCE             These violent delights have violent             ends!  PULL BACK: Father Laurence is preaching energetically from the pulpit.  Hidden from the congregation, Romeo waits in a small alcove chapel at the side of the altar.                           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)             The sweetest honey             Is loathsome in its own             deliciousness,             Therefore love moderately.  The Father glances toward Romeo.                           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)             Long love doth so.             Too swift arrives as tardy as too             slow. Juliet pushes through the double doors at the far end of the church.  Father Laurence motions to the middle-aged choir master who leads the choir into a choral version of Led Zeppelin\\'s \"A Whole Lot of Love\" with Latin lyrics.  Father Laurence hurries from the altar over to Romeo.                           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)             Here comes the lady.  Juliet bursts into the tiny chapel.  Trying to observe a vestige of decorum, she greets Father Laurence.                           JULIET             Good afternoon to my ghostly             confessor.  But before the priest can reply, the two lovers embrace, kissing passionately.                           FATHER LAURENCE                    (dryly)             Romeo shall thank thee, daughter,             for us both.  The choir completes the hymn and the priest, realising it is his cue, rushes back to the altar.  He quickly delivers a prayer to the congregation while eyeing the increasingly amorous smooching of the young couple.  The choir launch into a joyous chorus and the priest returns to Romeo and Juliet.  He delicately parts the couple.                           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)             Come, come, and we will make short             work.             For, by your leaves, you shall not             stay alone             Till Holy Church incorporate two in             one.  A young boy with a voice like Jamiroquai steps forward.  He launches into a wailing solo.  MACRO CLOSE UP: A simple silver ring.  Engraved on the inside of the band are the words \\'I love thee.\\'  PULL BACK: Romeo slips the ring onto Juliet\\'s finger as the priest executes the formal sacrament of marriage. INT./EXT.  CHURCH.  DAY.  CRANE UP: Through the majestic patterning of stained glass, and out of the church to find Peter, the chauffeur, cradling a small camera as he waits nervously beside the limo.  EXT.  CHURCH.  DAY.  The music swells in celebration.  Romeo and Juliet, now newly-wed, rush from the side door of the church.  The priest follows, throwing handfuls of rice.  Peter studiously takes a snap as the bride and groom kiss.  Peter holds the door of the limousine open.  Reluctantly Juliet gets into the car.  As the car pulls out of the driveway, Romeo runs alongside.  HOLD: On Romeo as he watches the big black car speed away.  EXT.  UNDERWATER.  DAY.  FISH-EYE VIEW: From the bottom of the ocean; Mercutio\\'s distorted features.  Gun aimed, he stares intently into the water.  A muffled BANG! and a bullet whizzes past the camera.  EXT.  VERONA BEACH.  DAY.  We see that Mercutio - wading in knee deep water close to the beach - is hunting fish.  Benvolio shelters in the shade of an unmanned life guard tower.  A shimmering heat haze blankets the deserted beach and the horizon is stacked with purple storm clouds.                           BENVOLIO             I pray thee, good Mercutio, let\\'s             retire.             The day is hot,  Mercutio, ignoring him, plugs away at another fish.  Benvolio nervously looks to see if there is any reaction to the sound of the shot.                           BENVOLIO (CONT.)             The Capels are abroad.  And if we             meet we shall not \\'scape a brawl.  Mercutio strides out of the water.                           MERCUTIO             Thou art like one of these fellows             that, when he enters the confines             of a tavern, claps me his sword             upon the table and says \\'God send             me no need of thee!\\'                    (he hands Benvolio                    his gun)             and by the operation of the second             cup draws him on the drawer, when             indeed there is no need.  Another incredible sleight of hand routine and Mercutio has managed to draw Benvolio\\'s pistol, retrieve his own gun, and trap Benvolio with a barrel at each temple.  The joke has worn thin for Benvolio; he pushes past Mercutio toward where Balthasar, Sampson and Gregory lounge in the shade of the beach-side hang.  Suddenly he stops dead - a monstrous black sedan prowls into the beach side parking lot.                           BENVOLIO             By my head, here comes the Capulets.                           MERCUTIO             By my heel, I care not.  EXT.  BEACH - PARKING LOT.  DAY.  The sedan mounts the curb and slides to a halt only metres from Benvolio and Mercutio.  Tybalt, Abra and Petruchio alight from the sedan and walk menacingly toward Mercutio and Benvolio.                           TYBALT             Gentlemen, good day.  A word with             one of you.  The boys from the hang, drawn the Capulet car, converge - eyes dart nervously, hands stray towards guns.  Mercutio smiles mockingly.                           MERCUTIO             And but one word with one of us?             Couple it with something.  Make it             a word and a...  Leaning close to Tybalt, he camps the implication.                           MERCUTIO (CONT.)             ...blow.  Mercutio scores.  The boys laugh.                           TYBALT                    (furious)             You shall find me apt enough to             that, sir,                    (clutching at his                    side arm)             And you will give me occasion.  CLOSE ON: Mercutio.  He stops, eyeing the hand on the gun. No one moves.                           MERCUTIO                    (a breathy, coquettish                    voice)             Could you not take some occasion             without giving?  The boys fall about again.  Tybalt cracks.                           TYBALT             Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.  The accusation stings - Mercutio\\'s anger flares.                           MERCUTIO             Consort?  What, dost thou make us             minstrels?  And thou make minstrels             of us look to hear nothing but             discords.  Here\\'s my fiddlestick.  Indicating his holstered gun.                           MERCUTIO (CONT.)             Here\\'s that shall make you dance.                    (barking at Tybalt)             Zounds,                    (goading him to go                    for his gun)             consort!  CLOSE ON: Tybalt.  CLOSE ON: Mercutio.  He will not back down.  Benvolio tries to diffuse things.                           BENVOLIO             Either withdraw unto some private             place.             Or reason coldly of your grievances.             Here all eyes gaze on us.                           MERCUTIO             Men\\'s eyes were made to look, and             let them gaze.             I will not budge for no man\\'s             pleasure, I.  At that moment, Romeo\\'s car pulls into the lot.  Tybalt smiles.                           TYBALT             Well sir, here comes my man.  Tybalt moves toward Romeo who bounds from his car full of happy news.                           TYBALT             Romeo, the love I bear thee can             afford             No better term than this:  CLOSE ON: Tybalt.  He clears his jacket from his side arm and issues the challenge.                           TYBALT (CONT.)             Thou art a villain!  CLOSE ON: Mercutio.  CLOSE ON: Benvolio.  All eyes are on Romeo.  Romeo calmly approaches his now cousin.                           ROMEO             Tybalt, the reason that I have to             love thee             Doth much excuse the appertaining             rage             To such a greeting: villain am I             none,             Therefore farewell.  I see thou             knowest me not.  Romeo turns, and to the amazement of all, walks back to his car.  Tybalt, unable to shoot him in the back, is confused. He hurls himself into his sedan.  Kicking it into a sand spraying U-turn, he careens the short distance to Romeo\\'s car.  Slamming into the back of it he blocks Romeo in.  Tybalt leaps out, maniacally kicking at bumper, door and headlights.  Romeo flicks the locks down.  Tybalt shatters the side window and hauls Romeo through the door, slamming him against the savaged fuselage.                           TYBALT             Boy, this shall not excuse the             injuries             That thou hast done me!  He smashes Romeo across the face, Romeo crashes to the roadway.                           TYBALT                    (yelling)             Turn and draw.  A cut has opened in the side of Romeo\\'s mouth.  He unsteadily lifts himself up, and meeting Tybalt\\'s gaze, speaks through bloodied teeth.                           ROMEO             I never injured thee,             And so, good Capulet, which name I             tender             As dearly as mine own...  Romeo cautiously extracts his gun...                           ROMEO (CONT.)             ...be satisfied.  ...and throws it at Tybalt\\'s feet.  Storm clouds obscure the sun as Romeo turns and walks from the parking lot.  Mercutio, Benvolio and the others cannot believe their eyes.                           MERCUTIO             O calm, dishonourable, vile             submission!  EXT.  BEACH - VACANT LOT.  DAY.  Tybalt\\'s anger must be answered.  He ceremoniously disarms, gives his weapon to Abra, and sprints after Romeo who is now passing a beach side lot that houses an abandoned grand hotel.  A bone-cracking kick sends Romeo crumbling into the vacant lot.  The boys swarm toward the fray. Romeo, still refusing the fight, scrambles up the stairs of the deserted hotel.  Tybalt trips him and Romeo careens into an ornamental wooden railing, smashing it to pieces.  Tybalt kicks savagely at the helpless Romeo.  Suddenly, Mercutio appears running full tilt down the concrete terrace.  He plucks up one of the splintered wooden palings and yells...                           MERCUTIO (CONT.)             Tybalt, you ratcatcher,  ...as he bludgeons him across the face.  Tybalt goes down.                           MERCUTIO (CONT.)             Will you walk?  Tybalt leaps to his feet grabbing a lump of wood.                           TYBALT             What wouldst thou have with me?  He swipes at Mercutio.                           MERCUTIO                    (avoiding)             Good King of Cats, nothing but one             of your nine lives.  Mercutio jabs, Tybalt sidesteps.                           TYBALT             I am for you.  Tybalt aims a double-handed blow to Mercutio\\'s head. Mercutio blocks, hooking Tybalt\\'s stick away.  Unarmed, Tybalt throws his full body weight upon Mercutio, slamming him against a window that shatters in a storm of glass.  Lightning fast, Mercutio jackknifes to his feet.  He raises his weapon to deliver a skull-crushing final blow to the trapped Tybalt.  Romeo rushes between them.                           ROMEO             Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio!  Seizing the opportunity, Tybalt lunges at Romeo with a lethal triangle of broken glass.  He misses, gouging instead a slash of flesh from Mercutio\\'s stomach. A scream of excruciating pain as Mercutio grabs at his bloodied side.  Everyone is still.  In the abrupt silence, sirens are heard closing in the distance.  Abra tugs at Tybalt.                           ABRA             Away Tybalt!  They bolt for their vehicle.  Benvolio goes to Mercutio.                           BENVOLIO             Art thou hurt?  But Mercutio, covering his wound with his hand, laughs.                           MERCUTIO             Ay, ay, a scratch.  He turns to his assembled fans at the bottom of the stairs. With outrageous bravado he plays at being Caesar the conqueror.                           MERCUTIO (CONT.)             A scratch!  The boys cheer their conquering hero.  Romeo helps Mercutio down the stairs.                           ROMEO             Courage, man.  The hurt cannot be             much.  Mercutio holding his bleeding side, jokes through the pain.                           MERCUTIO             \\'Twill serve.  Ask for me tomorrow             and you shall find me a grave man.  He turns the next thought to the assembled audience.                           MERCUTIO (CONT.)                    (through crazy laughter)             A plague o\\' both your houses!  Mercutio turns from the cheering boys to Romeo who is struggling to support his weight.  Mercutio - through weak and desperate breathing.                           MERCUTIO (CONT.)             Why the devil came you between us?             I was hurt under your arm. Romeo starts to register the panic in Mercutio\\'s eyes.                           ROMEO             I thought all for the best.  Like an animal trying to break free from a mortal trap, Mercutio pushes Romeo away.  He screams in horror, as if falling in the dark:                           MERCUTIO             A plague o\\' both your houses!             They have made worms\\' meat of me.  Mercutio staggers down the stairs and collapses in the dirt. Romeo is there instantly, cradling his friend\\'s head out of the dust.  The dying boy stares back at Romeo, smiling through the chilling cold.                           MERCUTIO (CONT.)                    (a silent whisper)             Your houses!  Everything stands still, everything is quiet.  The storm finally breaks.  EXT.  BEACH - RAIN.  DAY.  Tiny drops of water fall from the sky and bespeckle Mercutio\\'s lifeless body.  The droplets grow to a heavy rain. Romeo can hear the faint sound a thousand miles away of Benvolio whispering:                           BENVOLIO             Mercutio is dead!  Tears streak Romeo\\'s face.  He cries out.                           ROMEO             Oh sweet Juliet,             Thy beauty hath made me effeminate             And in my temper softened valor\\'s             steel!  The sound of Tybalt\\'s vehicle starting brings back cold reality.  Romeo\\'s sorrow turns to uncontrollable rage.  Shrugging aside Benvolio\\'s attempts to restrain him, Romeo runs to his car.  EXT.  BEACH - PARKING LOT.  DAY.  Up ahead Tybalt\\'s sedan screeches into a fishtailing U-turn and powers away. Romeo jumps into his vehicle.  In an effort to head Tybalt off, he guns his damaged machine down a one way street.  The rain is now blinding.  Romeo stops for nothing; pedestrians flee, cars spin out of control.  EXT.  VERONA BEACH STREETS - FROM AIR.  DAY.  AERIAL SHOT: The two cars speed along parallel roads toward Plaza Jesu.  Romeo is gaining.  EXT.  VERONA STREET - CHRIST ROUNDABOUT.  DAY.  CUT TO: Tybalt\\'s car negotiating the immense roundabout at the foot of the statue of Jesus.  EXT.  CHRIST ROUNDABOUT.  DAY.  CUT TO: Romeo\\'s car firing out of the one way street and slamming into Tybalt\\'s car.  Tybalt\\'s car careens out of control up the stairs of the statue, clips the fountain, flips, and slides upside down onto the roadway.  CUT TO: Tybalt scrambling from his upturned vehicle.  CUT TO: Romeo running toward him.  SUDDENLY Romeo is halted by Tybalt\\'s drawn gun.  Fearlessly marching toward it, he screams through tears.                           ROMEO             Mercutio\\'s soul             Is but a little way above our heads,  Romeo grabs the barrel of the gun; forcing it between his own eyes, he growls insanely at Tybalt.                           ROMEO (CONT.)             Staying for thine to keep him             company.  Tybalt, unnerved, tries to back off.                           TYBALT             Thou, wretched boy, shalt with him             hence.  Romeo, refusing to let go of the gun, forces Tybalt backward through the torrential rain.                           ROMEO                    (with frightening intensity)             Either thou or I, or both, must go             with him.  Cars swerve, Romeo is relentless.  He grips Tybalt\\'s hand trying to force him to shoot.                           ROMEO (CONT.)             Either thou or I, or both, must go             with him.  Panicked, Tybalt wrenches free and lurches onto the roadway. Blinded by the headlights of an oncoming car he thuds onto its hood as it skids to a halt.  The impact catapults his gun high into the air.  Romeo coldly follows its slow motion, spinning trajectory.  Real time stretches as the gun dances high above his head. Police sirens, cars swerving, people screaming, and the yelling of panicked commands fade to a nothingness.  Romeo stands calmly considering the gun in the air.  A harrowing symphonic tone and the echo of Mercutio\\'s voice can be heard.                           MERCUTIO (V/O)             Why the devil came you between us?  CUT TO: Patrol cars sliding to a halt.  CUT TO: The spinning gun slowly falling to earth.  CUT TO: Tybalt rising from the ground.  CUT TO: Cops leaping from their cars.  CUT TO: The gun landing in Romeo\\'s hand.  His eyes full of rage.  CUT TO: Cops levelling their revolvers.                           COP                    (Romeo in his sights)             Put up thy weapon.  CUT TO: Real time - Romeo fires three deliberate shots. Tybalt\\'s body convulses backwards against the car, hitting it with a thud, bloodying the shattered windscreen.  The cop fires.  A bullet grazes Romeo\\'s arm - his gun drops as he screams.                           ROMEO             O, I am fortune\\'s fool!  At that moment a roaring hurricane wind hits; blinding police.  CLOSE ON: The scaffolding surrounding the Jesus statue. Part of it\\'s canvas covering rips away.  Scaffold rains down as the insanely flapping material tries to smash free from it\\'s moorings.  Through the mayhem, a rusty Ford driven by Balthasar, slides to a halt.  Balthasar screams out at Romeo.                           BALTHASAR             Romeo, away be gone!  Stand not             amazed!  Romeo collapses into the front seat.  The cops open fire as Balthasar speeds off into the storm.  INT.  BALTHASAR\\'S CAR.  AFTERNOON.  Romeo is bleeding from the bullet graze.  EXT.  CAUSEWAY.  AFTERNOON.  The gale-force winds throw waves across the causeway as the fugitives disappear into the black afternoon.  CRANE UP: In the distance we see Montague and Capulet towers. Divided by the statue of Christ, they suffer the storm\\'s rage.  EXT.  MONUMENT.  AFTERNOON.  Away, below the outstretched arms of Christ, lights from emergency vehicles pulse red through the downpour.  THE CAMERA: Falls through heavy rain toward a woman crouched over the lifeless body of Tybalt.  She cries:                           GLORIA             Tybalt!  Cops nervously eye Fulgencio Capulet and Ted Montague, who, both flanked by body guards, face each other across the crime scene.  Medics stand by helplessly as Gloria clings to Tybalt\\'s body.  A handcuffed Benvolio looks on.                           GLORIA (CONT.)             Tybalt, my cousin, O my brother\\'s             child!             O, the blood is spilled of my dear             kinsman.  Police lines part as Captain Prince arrives.                           CAPTAIN PRINCE             Where are the vile beginners of             this fray?  Benvolio struggles forward.                           BENVOLIO             O noble Prince I can discover all             The unlucky manage of this fatal             brawl.  Gloria appeals hysterically:                           GLORIA             Prince as thou art true,             For blood of ours shed blood of             Montague!                           CAPTAIN PRINCE             Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?                           BENVOLIO                    (pointing to Tybalt\\'s corpse)             There lies the man, slain by young             Romeo,             That slew thy kinsman brave Mercutio.  Gloria interjects savagely.                           GLORIA             He speaks not true!  Affection             makes him false!                           BENVOLIO             Romeo, that spoke him fair, could             not take             Truce with the unruly spleen of             Tybalt             Deaf to peace!                           GLORIA             He is a kinsman to the Montague!             I beg for justice which thou Prince             must give.             Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not             live!  Captain Prince turns to Gloria.                          CAPTAIN PRINCE             Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio.             Who now the price of his dear blood             doth owe?  Ted Montague pleads:                           MONTAGUE             Not Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio\\'s             friend; His fault concludes but             what the law should end,             The life of Tybalt.  Captain Prince eyes Montague coldly.                           CAPTAIN PRINCE             And for that offence             Immediately we do exile him.  Montague, body guards in tow, surges forward.                           MONTAGUE             Noble Prince...?  Prince silences him.                           CAPTAIN PRINCE             I will be deaf to pleading and             excuses;             Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase             out abuses.             Therefore use none.  The Captain turns and addresses his assembled officers.                           CAPTAIN PRINCE (CONT.)             Let Romeo hence in haste,             Else, when he is found that hour is             his last.  CLOSE ON: Captain Prince.                           CAPTAIN PRINCE (CONT.)             Bear hence this body and attend our             will.             Mercy but murders, pardoning those             that kill.  INT.  JULIET\\'S BEDROOM.  AFTERNOON.  An acoustic guitar version of Joy Division\\'s \\'Love Will Tear Us Apart.\\' Juliet traces the path of a raindrop on the window pane as she speaks her thoughts to the storm.                           JULIET             Come gentle night, coming loving             black browed night,             Give me my Romeo.  And when I shall             die,             Take him and cut him out in little             stars,             And he will make the face of heaven             so fine             That all the world will be in love             with night,             And pay no worship to the garish             sun.             O, I have bought the mansion of a             love             But not possessed it, and though I             am sold,             Not yet enjoyed.  So tedious is             this day             As is the night before some festival             To an impatient child that hath new             robes             And may not wear them.  EXT.  CAPULET\\'S MANSION - DRIVEWAY.  AFTERNOON.  Juliet\\'s P.O.V.: The limousine pulls into the driveway.  PULL OUT: Of the window and CRANE DOWN: Juliet runs from the room.  EXT.  CAPULET MANSION.  AFTERNOON.  Through the open doorway we see an excited Juliet meet the Nurse at the bottom of the stairs.  The music surges.  TRACK IN: The Nurse\\'s words are lost in the storm.  Juliet buckles.  INT.  CAPULET MANSION.  AFTERNOON.  We are close enough now to hear Juliet\\'s words.                           JULIET             Oh God!  Did Romeo\\'s hand shed             Tybalt\\'s blood?                           NURSE             It did, it did!  Alas the day, it             did!                           JULIET             Oh serpent heart, hid with a             flowering face.             Was ever book containing such vile             matter             So fairly bound?  O, that deceit             should dwell             In such a gorgeous palace!                           NURSE             There\\'s no trust, No faith, no             honesty in men.  All perjured,             All forsworn, all naught, all             dissemblers.             Shame come to Romeo.                           JULIET             Blistered be thy tongue             For such a wish!  He was not born             to shame.  Upon his brow shame is             ashamed to sit.                           NURSE             Will you speak well of him that             killed your cousin?                           JULIET             Shall I speak ill of him that is my             husband?             Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall             smooth thy name             When I, thy three-hours wife have             mangled it?             But whyfore, villain, didst thou             kill my cousin?             That villain cousin would have             killed my husband.             All this is comfort, wherefore weep             I then?             Some word there was worser than             Tybalt\\'s death:             I would forget it fain - exiled.             Tybalt is dead, and Romeo exiled.             To speak that word is father,             mother,             Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet, all slain,             All dead.  Juliet sinks to the floor, overwhelmed by tears.                           JULIET (CONT.)             Nurse, I\\'ll to my wedding bed,             And death, not Romeo, take my             maidenhead.  Nurse looks down at Juliet.  She goes and comforts her.                           NURSE             Hie to your chamber.  I\\'ll find             Romeo             To comfort you.  I know well where             he is.             Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at             night.  Juliet looks up through tears.                           JULIET             O find him, give this ring to my             true knight,             And bid him come to take his last             farewell.  SLAM MACRO ZOOM: Into the ring.  The screen fills with the words \\'I love thee\\'.  INT.  PRESBYTERY BEDROOM.  NIGHT.  Romeo lies on the bed shirtless and crying.  His wound has been bandaged and Balthasar crouches frightened in the corner.  The priest leads the Nurse into the room.  Romeo looks up.                           ROMEO             Nurse!  She goes to him.                           NURSE             Ah sir!  Ah sir!  Death\\'s the end             of all.                           ROMEO             Speakest thou of Juliet?             Where is she?  And how doth she?             And what says             My concealed lady to our cancelled             love?                           NURSE             O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps             and weeps,             And then on Romeo cries, and then             falls down again.  Romeo is wailing inconsolably.                          ROMEO             As if that name,             Shot from the deadly level of a             gun,             Did murder her, as that name\\'s             cursed hand murdered her kinsman!  Father Laurence shakes the hysterical boy.                           FATHER LAURENCE             I thought thy disposition better             tempered!             Thy Juliet is alive, There art thou             happy.             The law that threatened death             becomes thy friend             And turns it to exile.  There art             thou happy.             A pack of blessings light upon thy             back.  Romeo calms.  The Nurse gives him the ring.                           NURSE             Here sir, a ring my lady bid me             give you.  Romeo enfolds the ring in his hand.                           ROMEO             How well my comfort is revived by             this.  The priest goes to his wardrobe, removes a clean white shirt and helps Romeo put it on.                           FATHER LAURENCE             Go, get thee to thy love, as was             decreed.             Ascend her chamber.  Hence and             comfort her.             But look thou stay not till the             Watch be set,             For then thou canst not pass to             Mantua where thou shalt live till             we can find a time             To blaze your marriage, reconcile             your friends,             Beg pardon of the Prince and call             thee back,             With twenty hundred thousand times             more joy             Than thou wentst forth in             lamentation.  Father Laurence ushers Romeo from the room.  INT.  HALLWAY.  NIGHT.  They hurry down the hallway.  The priest opens the front door.                           FATHER LAURENCE             Go hence.  Be gone by the break of             day             Sojourn in Mantua.  Give me thy hand.  Romeo embraces him.                           ROMEO             Farewell.  The priest and Balthasar watch as Romeo and the Nurse sprint for the car.  INT.  CAPULET MANSION.  NIGHT.  Sobs echo through the house.  Dave Paris stands in the entrance hallway clutching a huge bunch of flowers.  Fulgencio Capulet stands beside him, whisky glass in hand.  CUT TO: Gloria on the upper landing.  There is a strange faraway quality about her as she descends to Dave and Capulet.                           GLORIA             She\\'ll not come down tonight.  Dave, an understanding smile.                           DAVE             These times of woe afford no times             to woo.  Capulet guides Dave into the house.                           CAPULET             Look you, she loved her kinsman             Tybalt dearly.                           GLORIA                    (joining)             And so did I.                           CAPULET                    (a cold glance at Gloria)             Well, we were born to die.  Capulet takes a large slug of whisky.  Gloria leans close to Dave.                           GLORIA             I\\'ll know her mind early tomorrow.             Tonight she\\'s mewed up to her             heaviness.  As Gloria, Dave and Capulet exit down the hallway we CRANE UP: toward Juliet\\'s bedroom door.  INT.  JULIET\\'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.  CLOSE ON: Juliet\\'s face.  Tears stream onto the pillow. Without warning a hand lightly touches her cheek.  Juliet\\'s eyes dart up to discover Romeo standing above her.  A still moment of disbelief.  Leaning down, Roemo kisses away the tears that fall from her dark, wide eyes.  Juliet\\'s lips find Romeo\\'s and they gently sink back onto the bed.  INT.  SITTING ROOM.  NIGHT.  Capulet sits in an armchair drinking.  Dave and Gloria sit opposite as Capulet whips himself into a frenzy of drunken excitement.                           CAPULET             We\\'ll keep no great ado - a friend             or two.             For, hark you, Tybalt being slain             so late,             It may be thought we held him             carelessly,             Being our kinsman if we revel             much -             But soft what day is this?                           DAVE             Monday my lord.                           CAPULET             Well Wednesday is too soon - what             say you to Thursday?  Gloria looks up alarmed; Dave is stunned.                           DAVE             My lord I...                           CAPULET                    (leaning close)             I will make a desperate tender of             my child\\'s love.                    (a drunken good humour)             I think she will be ruled in all             respects by me;                    (exploding with                    hearty laughter)             Nay, more, I doubt it not!  CUT TO: Gloria, her face hardens.                           CAPULET                    (to Dave)             But what say you to Thursday?  Dave is trying to catch up.                           DAVE             My lord I...  CUT TO: Capulet he eyes Dave intently.                           DAVE (CONT.)             I would that Thursday were tomorrow.  Delighted, Capulet jumps to his feet.                           CAPULET             A Thursday let it be then!  Capulet holds out his glass in toast.  Dave and Gloria rise.                           CAPULET             Wife, go you to Juliet ere you go             to bed.             Tell her, a Thursday she shall be             married             To this noble sir!  CLOSE ON: The glasses clink.  EXT.  CAPULET ESTATE.  DAWN.  A pink and gold dawn breaks over Capulet Mansion.  INT.  JULIET\\'S BEDROOM.  DAWN.  A tangle of young limbs.  Romeo and Juliet blissfully asleep.  The dawn light creeps into the room.  EXT.  CAPULET ESTATE.  DAWN.  Balthasar\\'s car covertly pulls into a side road near the estate.  INT.  JULIET\\'S BEDROOM.  DAWN.  Romeo and Juliet still asleep.  CRANE DOWN: Toward the sleeping innocence of the faces.  HOLD: A shadow of fear passes across Romeo\\'s features.  With a cry of panic, he sits bolt upright.  Wide awake, but disorientated, Romeo stares around the room - as Juliet stirs, he remembers where he is.  Slipping quietly from the bed, Romeo begins to dress.  CLOSE ON: Romeo.  A pair of lips enter frame and find his neck.  It is Juliet.  She hugs herself to him.                           JULIET             Wilt thou be gone?  It is not yet             near day.  Romeo turns - softly he strokes her cheek.                           ROMEO             I must be gone and live, or stay             and die.  Juliet kisses his finger-tips.                           JULIET             Yond light is not daylight,  And then his cheek...                           JULIET (CONT.)             I know it, I             It is some meteor that the sun             exhales             To light thee on thy way to Mantua.             Therefore stay yet.  Thou needest             not to be gone.  Romeo, feverishly returning the kisses, throws himself on Juliet.                           ROMEO             Let me be taken, let me be put to             death.             I have more care to stay than will             to go.             Come, death, and welcome!  Juliet             wills it so.  Juliet is suddenly still.  Romeo kisses her gently.                           ROMEO (CONT.)             How is\\'t, my soul?  Let\\'s talk.  It             is not day.  Juliet pulls Romeo to his feet.                           JULIET             It is, it is!  Hie hence, be gone,             away!             O, now be gone!  More light and             light it grows.  Frantically she helps him into his clothes.                           ROMEO             More light and light: more dark and             dark our woes.  There is an urgent knocking on the door.  They freeze.                           NURSE (O/S)             Madam!                           JULIET             Nurse!                           NURSE (O/S)             Your lady mother is coming to your             chamber.                           JULIET             Then, window, let day in, and let             life out.  Desperately Juliet pulls Romeo out onto the balcony.  EXT.  BALCONY.  DAWN.  The storm, now past, has left a morning achingly pure.                           ROMEO             Farewell, farewell.  One kiss, and             I\\'ll descend. Romeo climbs down from the balcony and into the shadows.                           JULIET             O, think\\'st thou we shall ever meet             again?  Romeo smiles up at her.                           ROMEO             I doubt it not;  Juliet\\'s face darkens.                           JULIET             O God, I have an ill-divining soul.             Methinks I see thee, now thou art             so low,             As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.  Romeo scrambles back up to the balcony.                           ROMEO             Trust me, love, all these woes             shall serve             For sweet discourses in our times             to come.  From Juliet\\'s bedroom comes the brittle sound of Gloria Capulet\\'s voice.                           GLORIA             Ho daughter!  Are you up?  Juliet spins around.  Gloria has parted the curtains and is staring directly at her daughter.                           GLORIA             Well, well.  CUT TO: Romeo sheltered just below the lip of the balcony.  FOLLOW: His hand, as it slowly reaches up and touches Juliet\\'s fingers hidden behind her back.  Gloria returns to the room.  Juliet steals a glance toward Romeo as he silently mouths:                           ROMEO             Adieu, adieu!  As Romeo\\'s face disappears into the shadows Juliet whispers a little prayer to herself.                           JULIET             O Fortune, Fortune!  Be fickle,             Fortune,             Fo then I hope thou wilt not keep             him long             But send him back.  INT.  JULIET\\'S BEDROOM.  DAWN.  Juliet is trying not to cry as she goes in to her mother. Gloria turns to her.                           GLORIA             Thou hast a careful father, child:             One who, to put thee from thy             heaviness,             Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy             That thou expects not nor I looked             not for.  Juliet plays along.                           JULIET             Madam, in happy time.  What day is             that?  Gloria takes a deep breath.                           GLORIA             Marry, my child, early next Thursday             morn             The gallant, young, and noble             gentleman,             Sir Paris, at Saint Peter\\'s Church,             Shall happily make thee there a             joyful bride.  CLOSE ON: Juliet.  She can barely speak.                           JULIET             Now by Saint Peter\\'s Church, and             Peter too,             He shall not make me there a joyful             bride!  Fear passes across Gloria\\'s face.                           GLORIA             Here comes your father.  Tell him             so yourself.  Capulet - whisky glass in hand - ebulliently bursts into the room.                           CAPULET             How now, wife?             Have you delivered to her our decree?                           GLORIA             Ay, sir.  But she will none, she             gives you thanks.             I would the fool were married to             her grave!  Capulet - a dangerous calm.                           CAPULET             How?  Will she none?             Is she not proud?  Doth she not             count her blest,             Unworthy as she is, that we have             wrought             So worthy a gentleman to be her             bride?                           JULIET             Not proud you have, but thankful             that you have.             Proud can I never be of what I hate.  PAUSE: Capulet considers his daughter, then -  BAM!  He hurls his glass against the wall, shattering it into a thousand pieces.                           CAPULET             Thank me no thankings, nor proud me             no prouds,             But fettle your fine joints \\'gainst             Thursday next ...  Capulet advances.  Juliet, terrified, retreats into the hallway.                           JULIET             Hear me with patience but to speak             a word...  INT.  LANDING.  DAY.  The Nurse appears as Capulet picks his daughter up and shakes her like a rag doll.                           CAPULET             Speak not, reply not, do not answer             me!  He throws her to the floor.  His fist thuds as it slams into her face.                           GLORIA                    (screaming)             Fie, fie!  What are you mad?  Gloria tries to restrain Capulet.  He back-hands her, sending her flying against the wall - bellowing insanely, he advances on his cowering daughter.                           CAPULET             Hang thee, young baggage!             Disobedient wretch.  The Nurse throws herself between Capulet and Juliet.                           NURSE             God in heaven bless her!             You are to blame, my lord, to rate             her so.  Furious, Capulet shunts her aside.                           CAPULET             Peace, you mumbling fool!  Capulet yanks his daughter\\'s face close to his.                           CAPULET (CONT.)             I tell thee what - get thee to             church a Thursday             Or never after look me in the face.             And you be mine, I\\'ll give you to             my friend.             And you be not, hang, beg, starve,             die in the streets,             Trust to it.  Bethink you.  I\\'ll             not be forsworn.  Capulet storms off down the hall.  CLOSE ON: Juliet.  She huddles, shaking at the top of the stairs.                           JULIET             O sweet my mother, cast me not             away!             Delay this marriage for a month, a             week.             Or if you do not, make the bridal             bed             In that dim monument where Tybalt             lies.  A trickle of blood issues from Gloria\\'s cut lip.  She checks her appearance in the hall mirror.                           GLORIA             Talk not to me, for I\\'ll not speak             a word.             Do as thou wilt, for I have done             with thee.  Gloria leaves.                           JULIET             O God! - O Nurse, how shall this be             prevented?  The Nurse doesn\\'t reply.                           JULIET (CONT.)             What sayest thou?  Hast thou not a             word of joy?             Some comfort, Nurse.  A heavy silence.  The Nurse goes to Juliet.                           NURSE             Faith, here it is.             I think it best you married with             this Paris.             O, he\\'s a lovely gentleman!             I think you are happy in this             second match,             For it excels your first; or if it             did not,             Your first is dead - or \\'twere as             good he were             As living here and you no use of him.  Juliet is very still.                           JULIET             Speakest thou from thy heart?                           NURSE             And from my soul too.  Else beshrew             them both.                           JULIET             Amen.                           NURSE                    (unsure)             What?  Juliet is matter of fact.                           JULIET             Well, thou hast comforted me             marvellous much.             Go in; and tell my lady I am gone,             Having displeased my father, to             Friar Laurence,             To make confession and to be             absolved.  The old woman nods.  She strokes Juliet\\'s hair.                           NURSE             This is wisely done.  Juliet does not look up.  A disturbing choral chant:                                              DISSOLVE TO:  INT.  CHURCH.  DAY.  Sunlight pierces stained glass - the chant a sinister underscoring.  We hear Dave Paris\\' voice:                           DAVE (O/S)             Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt\\'s             death...  CRANE DOWN: Father Laurence and Dave Paris stand at the front of the church.                           DAVE (CONT.)             ...Now, sir, her father counts it             dangerous             That she doth give her sorrow so             much sway,             And in his wisdom hastes our             marriage             To stop the inundation of her             tears...  Father Laurence turns.  Juliet stands framed in the white glare of the doorway.  Dave smiles.                           DAVE             Happily met, my lady and my wife.  CLOSE ON: Juliet\\'s hand concealed beneath her coat - we can just see the handle of a gun.  Juliet advances slowly, an icy calm:                           JULIET             That may be, sir, when I may be a             wife.                           DAVE             That \\'may be\\', must be, love, on             Thursday next.  Juliet stares past Dave.                           JULIET             What must be, shall be.  Father Laurence, a forced cheerfulness.                           FATHER LAURENCE             That\\'s a certain text.                           DAVE             Come you to make confession?  Juliet forces a smile.                           JULIET             Are you at leisure, holy father,             now?             Or shall I come to you at evening             mass?                           FATHER LAURENCE             My leisure serves me, pensive             daughter, now.                    (to Dave)             We must entreat the time alone.                           DAVE             God shield I should disturb             devotion! - Juliet, on Thursday             early will I rouse ye;  Dave bends.  CLOSE ON: Juliet; she stares stonily ahead as Dave kisses her cheek.                           DAVE (CONT.)             Till then, adieu, and keep this             holy kiss.  Dave leaves.  TRACK WITH: Juliet; she runs for the sacristy.  The priest follows.  INT.  SACRISTY.  DAY.  Juliet, shaking with sobs takes refuge in the shadows of the small room.  The priest goes to her.                           FATHER LAURENCE             O Juliet, I already know thy grief.  Juliet pulls away.                           JULIET             Tell me not, Father, that thou             hearest of this,             Unless thou tell me how I may             prevent it.                           FATHER LAURENCE             It strains me past the compass of             my wits.                           JULIET                    (desperately)             If in thy wisdom thou canst give no             help             Do thou but call my resolution             wise,             And with this I\\'ll help it presently!  She pulls the gun, pointing it towards herself.  Horrified, Father Laurence moves to her.  Juliet, panicked, levels the gun at him.                           FATHER LAURENCE             Hold daughter!                           JULIET                    (through tears)             Be not so long to speak.  I lone to             die!  Father Laurence holds out a soothing hand.                           FATHER LAURENCE             I do spy a kind of hope,             Which craves as desperate an             execution             As that is desperate which we would             prevent.             If, rather than marry Paris,             Thou hast the strength of will to             slay thyself,             Then it is likely thou wilt             undertake             A thing like death...  We hear the distended chords of FaurÃ©\\'s Requiem.                           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)             to chide away this shame...  It continues throughout as;  The entire screen fills with a glinting tear drop of blue liquid.  Reflected in the fluid\\'s convex surface, the face of Father Laurence.  The face disappears as the tear drop falls and splashes into a clear water solution.  Like a comet in slow motion, the drop stains the water a cobalt hue.  INT.  GREENHOUSE WORKROOM.  DAY.  PULL BACK: The blue liquid fills a tiny glass vial held by Father Laurence.                           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)             No warmth, no breath shall testify             thou livest.             Each part, deprived of supple             government,             Shall stiff and stark and cold             appear, like death.             Now when the bridegroom in the             morning             Comes to rouse thee from thy bed,             there art thou, dead.             Thou shalt be borne to that same             ancient vault             Where all the kindred of the             Capulets lie.             In the meantime, against thou shalt             awake,             Shall Romeo by my letters know our             drift,             And hither shall he come.             And that very             Night shall Romeo bear thee hence             to Mantua.  The priest cautiously hands Juliet the vial.                           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)             Take thou this vial, being then in             bed,             And this distilling liquor drink             thou off.             I\\'ll send my letters to thy lord             with speed to Mantua.  EXT.  CHURCH.  DAY.  As Father Laurence speaks, the screen fills with an express envelope addressed \"Romeo - Mantua.\" The envelope pulls away from the camera and falls into a canvas bag brimming with hundreds of like envelopes.  TRACK: With the canvas bag.  It continues its journey into the back of an express delivery van.  Heavy double doors slam shut, filling the screen with the slogan \\'Speed Express.\\'  The van pulls away.                                              DISSOLVE TO:  EXT.  MANTUA.  DAY.  A burning red sun is setting over an endless vista of ragged wasteland.  CRANE DOWN: A weathered sign reads - Mantua: Behind it a vast colony of permanent trailer homes stretches into the distance.  The rap, rap, rap of knocking echoes through the park...  CUT TO: The source of the knocking.  An express delivery man, envelope in hand, raps vigorously on the door of an unremarkable trailer.  INT.  TRAILER.  DAY.  TOPOGRAPHICAL SHOT: Romeo lies flat on a single bed in the crampled trailer.  The rap, rap, rap is very loud now.  We move toward Romeo and realise he cannot hear the knocking because he has Walkman headphones on.  EXT.  TRAILER.  DAY.  Unsuccessful, the delivery man is filling out a \"WE CALLED\" card.  He pushes it under the door.                                              DISSOLVE TO:  INT.  CAPULET MANSION.  NIGHT.  The heraldic \\'Wedding Chimes\\' by JS Bach.  Juliet stands resplendent in a radiant bridal gown.  The image floats ethereally in a towering slab of mirror.  PULL OUT: From the mirror.  The wedding dress is in fact being held in front of Juliet by two members of the house staff.  Juliet is dressed in her night gown.  The Nurse suggests various pairs of shoes.                           JULIET                    (disinterested)             Ay, these attires are best.  The fuss dispensed with, the staff leave.                           JULIET             But, gentle Nurse,             I pray thee leave me to myself             tonight.                           NURSE             Why Bride?  Juliet navigates the Nurse toward the door.                           JULIET                    (almost in tears)             To move the heavens to smile upon             my state,             Which, well thou knowest, is cross             and full of sin.  Juliet holds the Nurse in a pleading stare.  She leaves.  Alone now, Juliet hurries to her bedside drawer.  She cautiously removes a rolled piece of cloth from which she produces the glass vial.                           JULIET                    (whispers)             What if this mixture do not work at             all?             Shall I be married then tomorrow             morning?  She cautiously begins to unscrew the tiny black lid. Suddenly, a knock at her door.  Palming the vial, Juliet swings around to meet the arrival of her mother.  Gloria probes her daughter\\'s uneasiness.                           GLORIA             What, are you busy, ho?  Need you             my help?                           JULIET                    (makes light of it)             No, madam.  We have culled such             necessaries             As are behoveful for our state             tomorrow.             So please you, let me now be left             alone,             And let the Nurse this night sit up             with you.  Juliet begins to pull down the covers on her bed.                           JULIET (CONT.)             For I am sure you have your hands             full all             In this so sudden business.  Gloria, sensing Juliet\\'s distress, moves cautiously toward her.  Taking hold of the bed covers she helps her daughter into bed.                           GLORIA             Good night.  Juliet slides into bed.  Gloria covers her with the blanket.                           GLORIA (CONT.)             Get thee to bed, and rest, for thou             hast need.  A brief moment between mother and daughter.  Gloria, unable to cross that final barrier, moves to the door; but she is stopped by the urgency in Juliet\\'s voice.                           JULIET             Farewell!  Gloria turns to Juliet.                           JULIET (CONT.)             God knows when we shall meet again.  CLOSE ON: Gloria.  A faint perplexity, and then with an almost warm smile she turns out the light and leaves.  The room is in darkness but for patterns of moonlight through windows.  TRACK: Toward Juliet.  The sombre tones of FaurÃ©\\'s Requiem seep into our consciousness.                           JULIET             I have a faint cold fear thrills             through my veins             That almost freezes up the heat of             life.  She brings the vial her mouth.                           JULIET (CONT.)             Come, vial.  Romeo, I drink to thee.  Juliet drinks, a sudden violent convulsion, her face contorts in fear.                                              DISSOLVE TO:  EXT.  CAPULET ESTATE.  DAY.  The sky is filled with green and grey clouds.  A gusty rain blows the flower arrangements across the lawn.  Large white wedding marquees flap in the wind.  Through blurring rain, we see ambulances and police vehicles, lights flashing.  Father Laurence, accompanied by a dour looking man in black, alights from his car.  We follow their P.O.V.: We hear snatches of radio calls.                           MEDIC ONE (OVER RADIO)             Mortal drugs?                           MEDIC TWO (OVER RADIO)             Of lethal quantity as \\'twould             render death.  INT.  CAPULET MANSION - DINING ROOM.  DAY.  They enter the house and pass the vast dining room, bedecked with wedding decorations.  Capulet sits at the large mahogany table.  In the background Gloria stares vacantly.  Moving swiftly toward a doorway, the music builds.  INT.  CAPULET MANSION - JULIET\\'S BEDROOM.  DAY.  The door opens.  On the bed Juliet\\'s still body.  Father Laurence closes the door.  The priest kneels and hastily examines Juliet\\'s pupils.  He looks to the man in black who retrieves the glass vial from the floor and pockets it.                           FATHER LAURENCE                    (to the man in black)             As the custom is,             In all her best array bear her to             church.  When the man in black allows two other dark suited men into the room, it becomes clear he is the undertaker.                           UNDERTAKER             She shall be borne to that same             ancient vault             Where all the kindred of the             Capulets lie.  INT.  MAUSOLEUM.  DAY.  A thousand voices proclaim the \\'Song of Ascension.\\'  PAN DOWN: From the vaulting glass ceiling of the Capulet mausoleum.  On view, enshrined in literally thousands of lit candles, is Juliet\\'s peaceful body.  We move through lines of Capulet mourners.  In the shadows of the front door a young man hides.  CLOSE ON: The young man.  We recognise the distressed face of Balthasar.  PUSH IN: Balthasar rushes from the Mausoleum.  EXT.  MANTUA.  DAY.  We are high above Mantua.  Beyond the trailer park stretches a long ribbon of black highway.  As a Speed Express van turns off the highway and into the park, we hear Romeo\\'s voice over:                           ROMEO (V/O)             If I may trust the flattering truth             of sleep             My dreams presage some joyful news             at hand...  CRANE DOWN: The Express van pulls up at the front office. The driver alights and goes inside.  INT.  TRAILER.  DAY.  Romeo sits at the trailer\\'s small kitchen table smoking and writing in his notebook.  The \"WE CALLED\" card lies next to an overflowing ashtray.  His voice over continues.                           ROMEO (V/O)             And all this day an unaccustomed             spirit             Lifts me above the ground with             cheerful thoughts.             I dreamt my lady came and found me             dead             And breathed such life with kisses             in my lips             That I revived and was an emperor.             Ah me, how sweet is love itself             possessed             When but love\\'s shadows are so rich             in joy.  Stubbing out his cigarette, Romeo gazes through the trailer window to see Balthasar\\'s speeding car turn off the highway and into the trailer park.                           ROMEO             News from Verona!  An excited Romeo rushes from the trailer.  EXT.  TRAILER PARK.  DAY.  CRANE HIGH: Romeo sprints across open ground to intercept Balthasar\\'s car.  We see, but Romeo cannot, the Express van approaching from the office.  The car slews to a halt and Balthasar jumps out.  Romeo yells joyously.                           ROMEO             How now, Balthasar?  Bathlasar cannot speak.                           ROMEO (CONT.)             Dost thou not bring me letters from             the Priest?             How doth my lady?  Is my father             well?             How doth my lady Juliet?  That I             ask again,             For nothing can be ill if she be             well.  Balthasar does not know how to say what he has come to tell. He looks away.                           BALTHASAR             Then she is well and nothing can be             ill.             Her body sleeps in Capels\\' monument,             And her immortal part with angels             lives.             I saw her laid low in her kindred\\'s             vault.  For a long moment Romeo is profoundly still.  When he speaks, it is with a chilling calm.                           ROMEO             Is it e\\'en so?  Balthasar nods.  Romeo turns and stares into the distant wasteland.  CLOSE ON: He speaks with bitter determination.                           ROMEO             Then I defy you stars.  Romeo moves to the car.                           ROMEO             I will hence tonight.  Balthasar tries to restrain him.                           BALTHASAR             Have patience...  Exploding with fury, Romeo throws Balthasar against the vehicle.                           ROMEO             Leave me!  CUT TO: The Speed Express messenger.  Returning to his truck, the priest\\'s undelivered envelope in his hand, the messenger looks toward the two boys.  CUT TO: The boys.  Balthasar pleads with Romeo.                           BALTHASAR             Your looks are pale and wild and do             import             Some misadventure.                           ROMEO                    (with cold serenity)             Tush, thou art deceived.                    (a niggling thought)             Hast thou no letters to me from the             Priest?  Balthasar shakes his head.  Romeo smiles.                           ROMEO             No matter - I will hence tonight.  Romeo climbs into the passenger seat of the car.  Balthasar reluctantly gets behind the wheel.  As silent tears begin to flow, Romeo turns his face to the setting sun.  PUSH IN: As he whispers:                           ROMEO             Well Juliet, I will lie with thee             tonight.  Balthasar\\'s car roars out of the park.  CUT TO: The delivery man.  He looks to the envelope in his hand, then gets back into his truck.  EXT.  HIGHWAY.  NIGHT.  Balthasar\\'s car speeds along the night-time highway.  CRANE UP: In the distance the glow of city lights.  EXT.  ALLEYWAY.  NIGHT.  Balthasar\\'s car pulls into an alley and stops outside a decrepity apartment block. INT.  APARTMENT BLOCK.  NIGHT.  CLOSE ON: A bespectacled eye peers through the crack of a partly open doorway.  Below the face, the barrel of a shotgun protrudes menacingly.  CUT TO: Romeo in the dark, paint peeling hallway.                           ROMEO             Let me have             A dram of poison, such soon-             speeding gear             As will disperse itself through all             the veins             That the life-weary taker may fall             dead.  The eye considers, a voice rasps back.                           APOTHECARY             Such mortal drugs I have, but             Verona\\'s law             Is death to any he that utters them.  Romeo speaks with fury.                           ROMEO             The world is not thy friend, nor             the world\\'s law.             Then be not poor, but break it and             take this.  Romeo shoves a wad of money at THE APOTHECARY\\'S face.  BEAT.  The rattle of a latch chain and the door swings open.  Standing in the doorway is The Apothecary.  Sixty something, he has a face scarred with age and abuse.                           APOTHECARY             My poverty, but not my will consents.  CLOSE ON: Romeo.                           ROMEO             I pay thy poverty and not thy will.  INT.  PRESBYTERY.  NIGHT.  CLOSE ON: Father Laurence.  He speaks into the telephone with concern.                           FATHER LAURENCE             Who bore my letter then to Romeo?  INT.  SPEED EXPRESS DEPOT.  NIGHT.  A bored clerk is on the other end of the line.  The priest\\'s letter is on the counter beside him.                           CLERK             I could not sent it - here it is             again.  INT.  PRESBYTERY.  NIGHT.  Father Laurence is worried.                           FATHER LAURENCE             By my brotherhood, unhappy fortune!             The letter was of dear import.                    (PAUSE: the priest listens)             Adieu.  He hangs up the receiver and looks at the wall clock.                           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)             Now must I to the monument alone.             Within this hour will fair Juliet             awake.  DISSOLVE FROM: The clock to...  INT.  APOTHECARY\\'S APARTMENT.  NIGHT.  CLOSE ON: A cat skitters across a stained formica table.  PULL BACK: The Apothecary\\'s apartment is filled with cats. Dozens of feline eyes glow in the dim room.  Romeo stands nervously.  The Apothecary extracts a small chemist\\'s vial from inside a \\'Statue of Our Lady\\' table lamp - he now speaks with cool professionalism.                           APOTHECARY             Drink it off and if you had the             strength of twenty men it would             dispatch you straight.  Romeo takes the vial and hands over the money.                           ROMEO             There is my gold - worse poison to             men\\'s souls             Than these poor compounds that thou             mayst not sell.  INT.  BALTHASAR\\'S CAR.  NIGHT.  Motor running, Balthasar waits in the alley outside the apartment building.  He checks the rear view mirror and freezes.  At the end of the alleyway a police car crawls to a halt.  EXT.  ALLEYWAY.  NIGHT.  Romeo exits the building, and as he does so, the streetlight catches his face.  The Cop\\'s and Romeo\\'s eyes meet.  INT.  POLICE CAR.  NIGHT.  CLOSE ON: The cop.                           COP             This is that banished haughty             Montague.  INT.  BALTHASAR\\'S CAR.  Balthasar cracks; he guns the engine and the car lurches forward.  EXT.  ALLEYWAY.  NIGHT.  Tires screech as Romeo dives into the passenger seat of Balthasar\\'s moving vehicle.  Siren blaring, the police car gives chase.  AERIAL SHOT.  NIGHT.  Balthasar\\'s car winds through traffic - the patrol car gaining.  EXT.  ANOTHER PART OF TOWN.  NIGHT.  A police car U-turns over a median strip.  EXT.  BALTHASAR\\'S CAR.  NIGHT.  TIGHT ON: A rusted brown hood.  The tortured engine screams as Balthasar negotiates the speeding car through city traffic.  CRANE UP: Red and blue police light approach fast.  INT.  PRECINCT OFFICE.  NIGHT.  Captain Prince barrels through the corridors of police headquarters pulling on his flying jacket.  EXT.  STREET.  NIGHT.  TIGHT ON: A smoking tire as it lays rubber to the asphalt.  Balthasar grits his teeth as he weaves the car through the impossibly tight space between a container truck and a bus.  WHIP PAN: The patrol car is almost upon them when... in a seemingly suicidal manoeuvre Balthasar throws his car into a right-angle turn across four lanes of oncoming traffic. Horns blare.  CUT TO: A skidding, squealing, out of control sedan, braking to avoid collision.  Miraculously, Balthasar\\'s vehicle shoots out of it its path and onto the other side of the roadway.  The sedan slams into the following patrol car.  EXT.  DRIVEWAY.  NIGHT.  Balthasar\\'s car speeds into the driveway of the Verona Beach Eternal Rest Cemetery.  INT.  CHOPPER.  NIGHT.  Captain Prince scans the night time city below.  He speaks to the pilot and the chopper banks sharply.  EXT.  CEMETERY.  NIGHT.  CLOSE ON: A stone angel etched against the night sky.  PAN DOWN: Romeo pulls a crowbar from the trunk of the parked car.  Police sirens sound in the distance.  Romeo eyes Balthasar intently.                           ROMEO             Upon thy life, whatever thou             hearest             Or seest, stand all aloof.  Give me             the light -  Balthasar stands motionless - Romeo rips the torch from his hands and strides into the cemetery.  Balthasar follows.                           BALTHASAR             I do beseech you...  Romeo turns, punching Balthasar hard; he goes down, blood spurting from his nose.                           ROMEO             Do not interrupt me in my course or             By heaven I will tear thee joint by             joint             And strew this hungry churchyard             with thy limbs!  Balthasar slowly rises.  Both boys are trying hard not to cry.                           ROMEO (CONT.)             The time and my intents are savage             wild,             More fierce and more inexorable far             Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.                           BALTHASAR             I will be gone and not trouble ye.  Romeo smiles.                           ROMEO             So shalt thou show me friendship.  They embrace as Romeo whispers.                           ROMEO (CONT.)             Live, and be prosperous; and             farewell, good fellow.  EXT.  MAUSOLEUM.  NIGHT.  CLOSE ON: A crowbar wrenches at ornate glass and iron doors.  PULL BACK: The Gothic structure of the mausoleum rears against the night sky.  Romeo frenziedly attacks the gates of the small side chapel.                           ROMEO             Thou detestable maw, thou womb of             death,             Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to             open.  With a final heave the doors scrape open.  Silence.  ROMEO\\'S P.O.V.: An endless marble corridor lit by hundreds of tiny flickering eternal flames.  CLOSE ON: Romeo.  He murmurs:                          ROMEO             In despite I\\'ll cram thee with more             food.  Suddenly a hurricane wind and whirr of machinery: like a huge black insect, Captain Prince\\'s chopper swoops down over the mausoleum.  Romeo is caught in the glare of the chopper\\'s burning arc light.  Sirens scream, police units race through the cemetery. Blinded, Romeo fires wildly toward the chopper.  The police cars screech to a halt.  CLOSE ON: A police marksman in the chopper.  His finger squeezes the rifle trigger.  BANG!  A bullet slams into Romeo\\'s shoulder.  The other cops open fire and Romeo is sent reeling backwards into the mausoleum in a fusillade of bullets.  INT.  CHOPPER.  NIGHT.  An angry Captain Prince bellows into the radio.                           CAPTAIN PRINCE             Hold!  Hold!  The police hold their fire.  INT.  MAUSOLEUM.  NIGHT.  Bleeding from the shoulder wound, Romeo drags shut the heavy double doors of the chapel.  He bangs off three shots through a pane of broken glass and screams at the police.                           ROMEO             Stand all aloof!  EXT.  MAUSOLEUM.  NIGHT.  Outside the chopper hovers.  Police take up siege positions. Captain Prince\\'s voice echoes through the bullhorn.                           CAPTAIN PRINCE             Romeo, come forth, come forth.  INT.  MAUSOLEUM.  NIGHT.  Romeo uses the crowbar to wedge the doors shut.  He bangs off another shot as he yells out at the Police.                           ROMEO             Tempt not a desperate man!  Romeo waits.  There is no response from the cops.  INT.  CHOPPER.  NIGHT.  As the chopper settles to earth, Captain Prince speaks into the radio.                           CAPTAIN PRINCE             Bring forth these enemies Montague             and Capulet.  INT.  PRIEST\\'S CAR.  NIGHT.  Orange rescue lights reflect through the windshield of the priest\\'s car as it crawls past the crashed sedan and police vehicle.  Father Laurence thumps the steering wheel in frustration.                           FATHER LAURENCE             Saint Francis be my speed tonight!  Across the road Police swarm around the entrance to the cemetery.                           FATHER LAURENCE             Fear comes upon me.             O, much I fear some ill unthrifty             thing.  HOLD ON: The green glow of the car clock as the seconds pulse away.  INT.  MAUSOLEUM.  NIGHT.  TRACK: Down the marble corridor lit by the eternal flames.  DISCOVER: Romeo.  He weakly stands at the entrance to the viewing chapel.  The chapel is dark.  As Romeo\\'s eyes adjust he can just see, picked out by a shaft of blue moonlight, the glowing figure of a sleeping girl.  He moves down the aisle past the tombs of long-dead Capulets.  Romeo is close now.  He halts as if in the presence of an unbelievable vision.  He lights a match and the room glows gold.  The warm light reveals a Juliet even more beautiful in seeming death.  Romeo lights some of the hundreds of candles that surround her.                           ROMEO             O my love, my wife,             Death, that hath sucked the honey             of thy breath,             Hath had no power yet upon thy             beauty,             Thou art not conquered.  Beauty\\'s             ensign yet             Is crimson in thy lips and in thy             cheeks,             And death\\'s pale flag is not             advanced there.  Romeo kneels close, as if not wanting to wake a sleeping child.  Unconscious tears fall from his eyes as he whispers.                           ROMEO (CONT.)             Ah, dear Juliet, why art thou yet             so fair?             Shall I believe that unsubstantial             death             Is amorous and keeps thee here in             dark             To be his paramour?  For fear of             that             I still will stay with thee.  Here,             oh here             Will I set up my everlasting rest             And shake the yoke of inauspicious             stars             From this world-wearied flesh.  He lays himself close.                           ROMEO (CONT.)             Eyes, look your last.             Arms, take your last embrace.  And,             lips, O you             The doors of breath, seal with a             righteous kiss...  Gently Romeo kisses Juliet\\'s lips.  Ever so slightly, Juliet\\'s hand moves - Romeo does not notice.                           ROMEO (CONT.)             A dateless bargain to engrossing             death.  Romeo drinks from the vial; the power of the compound is immediate.  He convulses and falls, his head resting on Juliet.                           ROMEO (CONT.)                    (fighting for breath)             O true apothecary, thy drugs are             quick.  Behind Romeo\\'s head we can see Juliet\\'s eyes opening.  Romeo sucks the last few breaths of life into his lungs.  Through a blurry consciousness Juliet becomes aware of Romeo.                           JULIET             Oh Romeo, what\\'s here?  Forcing herself up, she cradles his head in her arms. Romeo\\'s clear wide eyes stare back, he is completely still but for the sound of weak breaths desperately drawn across motionless lips.  Juliet finds the vial clenched in Romeo\\'s hand.  Tears slip from her eyes.                           JULIET (CONT.)             Drunk all, and left             No friendly drop to help me after.             I will kiss thy lips.             Haply some poison yet doth hang on             them             To make me die with a restorative.  She delicately kisses Romeo\\'s lips.                           JULIET (CONT.)                    (a heart-broken whisper)             Thy lips are warm.  Desperately the lovers cling to each other.  With all his desire to stay alive, Romeo whispers:                           ROMEO             Thus with a kiss I die.  There is no breath.  He is still.  Silence.  Sobbing, Juliet hugs the lifeless Romeo to her.                           JULIET             Romeo.  O\\' my true love Romeo.  She looks to the gun in his hand.  EXT.  MAUSOLEUM.  NIGHT.  TRACK: Quickly past Captain Prince and the Capulets taking cover behind a patrol car.  Two police officers urgently convey Montague and his wife toward them.  Discover Father Laurence arriving.  CUT TO: Father Laurence\\'s P.O.V.: Patrol cars, lights flashing, surround the mausoleum.  He sees, through the open door of a police car, a hand- cuffed youth.  It is Balthasar.  Father Laurence hurries to him.  It is dawning on Father Laurence.                           FATHER LAURENCE             Balthasar?                           BALTHASAR                    (desperately)             I brought news of Juliet\\'s death...             And then in post came Romeo from             Mantua             To this same place... to this same             monument.  CLOSE ON: Father Laurence.                           FATHER LAURENCE             How long hath he been there?                           BALTHASAR             Full half an hour.  Father Laurence turns towards the mausoleum.                           FATHER LAURENCE             Romeo.                    (a shock of realisation)             The lady stirs...  INT.  MAUSOLEUM.  NIGHT.  TRACK SLOW TOWARD: Juliet: Sobbing uncontrollably she prises the gun from Romeo\\'s hand.  EXT.  MAUSOLEUM.  NIGHT.  Father Laurence, desperate, breaks through the police line and runs toward the mausoleum.  CUT TO: The parents and Captain Prince.                           CAPTAIN PRINCE             Hold!  Go not forth!  INT.  MAUSOLEUM.  NIGHT.  Juliet turns the gun on herself.  EXT.  MAUSOLEUM.  NIGHT.  CLOSE ON: Father Laurence, he screams as he mounts the mausoleum stairs.                           FATHER LAURENCE             The lady stirs!  CRACK!  The sound of a single gun shot rips through the night.  CUT TO: Captain Prince.  CUT TO: The parents, a look of cold shock.  CUT TO: The priest - his cry echoes through the night.  INT.  MAUSOLEUM.  NIGHT.  Juliet lies peacefully on Romeo\\'s chest.  Her eyes awake.  A wash of deep red blood floods across them both.  As we move away from the forms of the two young lovers lit by a ring of candles, the police burst in, guns ready to resolve what has already been resolved.  Continuing up, we pass through the glass dome of the viewing chapel, and over the building.  EXT.  MAUSOLEUM.  NIGHT.  There, huddled at the base of the Mausoleum steps, are the Montague and Capulet parents and Father Laurence.  From high up we see Captain Prince emerge from the Mausoleum and speak to the group.  A moment, then their cries float gently up.  EXT.  SKY.  NIGHT.  We are travelling high into the sky now.  The cries of the parents and the buzz of radio calls fade to nothing.  EXT.  VERONA BEACH STREET - CHRIST ROUNDABOUT-FROM AIR.  DAWN.  As the sun struggled to rise, we push toward the figure of Jesus silently surveying the city.  EXT.  VERONA BEACH - CHRIST ROUNDABOUT.  DAWN.  As Jesus\\' face fills the screen, droplets of water begin to streak his cheeks.  HOLD: Music swells; the droplets grow to a torrent, and a heavy rain begins to fall.  For a long beat, we stay with this image.  CRANE DOWN: From the Jesus.  A sea of black umbrellas stretches back from the steps of Freedom Tower.  EXT.  FREEDOM TOWER.  DAY.  At the top of the steps are a pair of flower strewn caskets. Before the caskets stand Fulgencia and Gloria Capulet, and Ted and Caroline Montague.  They stare with blank, uncomprehending sorrow.  Among the crowd we see the distraught faces of Benvolio, Balthasar, Father Laurence and the Nurse.  The caskets are gently slid into a pair of long black cars. Montague and Capulet descend the stairs.  Captain Prince blocks their path.  He holds them in his gaze.                           CAPTAIN PRINCE             See what a scourge is laid upon             your hate,             That heaven finds means to kill             your joys with love;             And I, for winking at your discords             too,             Have lost a brace of kinsmen.  All             are punished.  The Prince steps aside.  The procession moves off.  Montague and Capulet look to one another, a moment, and then the two adversaries together follow the bodies of their dead children.  AERIAL SHOT: The rain falls.  Two black cars lead the people of Verona Beach in a sorrowful parade.  As the cars pass beneath the towering effigy of Jesus, the image pixilates into a television picture.  PULL OUT: A TV anchor woman watches the image on a studio monitor.  She turns:                           ANCHOR WOMAN                    (to camera)             A glooming peace this morning with             it brings:             The sun for sorrow will not show             his head.             Go hence, to have more talk of             these sad things.             Some shall be pardoned, and some             punished,             For never was a story of more woe             Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.  The anchor woman changes beat to the next story; but her dialogue fades, and her image gets smaller as the television recedes into a black distance.  The music that reminds us most of these two lost lives swells.  When the television is very small it is switched off.  BLACK SCREEN.  HOLD A BEAT.                           END CREDITS         '"

       "' WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE\\'S ROMEO & JULIET ADAPTED FOR THE SCREEN BY CRAIG PEARCE AND BAZ LUHRMANN FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT October 6, 1995 EXT. HIGHWAY. AFTERNOON. A ribbon of freeway stretching into a blue and pink late afternoon sky. A huge dark sedan, windows tinted gold, headlights blazing, powers directly for us. CUT TO: A heavy, low-slung, pickup truck traveling toward the sedan. WIDE SHOT: Sky, freeway, the cars closing. TIGHT ON: The sedan. TIGHT ON: The pickup. Like thunderous, jousting opponents, the cars pass in a deafening cacophony of noise. INT. TRUCK. AFTERNOON. TIGHT ON: The fat face of GREGORY, yelling at the disappearing sedan. GREGORY A dog of the house of Capulet moves me! He and the pimply-faced front-seat passenger, SAMPSON, explode with laughter. The red-haired driver BENVOLIO, keeps his eyes on the road. EXT. EXIT RAMP. AFTERNOON. The truck spirals down an exit ramp and screeches into busy driveway of a large gas station. EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON. Attendants immediately run to the truck. Two clean windshields and duco, the third fills the gas tank. INT. TRUCK. AFTERNOON. Gregory in the back seat is boasting outrageously. GREGORY A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take the wall of any man or maid of Capulets. Sampson, sarcastically. SAMPSON That shows thee a weak slave. For the weakest goes to the wall. GREGORY \\'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore, I will push Capulet\\'s men from the wall, and thrust his maids to the wall. Benvolio, disgusted, gets out of the car. BENVOLIO The quarrel is between our masters... GREGORY (yelling after him) ...and us their men. EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON. FOLLOW: Benvolio as he heads for the bathroom. PICK UP: A mother wrangling three little boys out of a station wagon - the smallest kid carries a toy pistol. SUPER FAST SCAN TRACK: Past the mother to - the huge black sedan pulling up outside the gas station mini-mart. The front door of the sedan opens. Shiny black boots - decorated with tiny, silver, cat-shaped spurs - plant themselves on the ground. The boots are joined by two other pairs of well-shod feet. HOLD: The spurred boots move out of frame. CRANE UP: The other feet belong to a tough-looking Latin youth ABRA - and his goateed side-kick PETRUCHIO. Abra and Petruchio enter the mini-mart, as four white-clad girls exit. FOLLOW: The girls as they head for their car. SUPER FAST SCAN TRACK: Past the girls to: INT. TRUCK. AFTERNOON. Sampson is trying to out boast Gregory. SAMPSON I will show myself a tyrant. When I have fought with the men I will be civil with the maids, I will cut off their heads. Gregory; mock outrage. GREGORY The heads of the maids? Sampson leers lecherously at the girls. SAMPSON Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maiden heads, take it in what sense thou wilt. GREGORY They must take it in sense that feel it. Gregory and Sampson pump up the song on the sound system and sing out at the girls. GREGORY/SAMPSON (singing) I am a pretty piece of flesh! I am a pretty piece of flesh! Me, they shall feel while I am able to stand; I am a pretty piece of flesh! The girls, pretending not to notice, get into the car. EXT. GAS STATION - MINIMART. AFTERNOON. GREGORY\\'S P.O.V.: The car pulls away revealing... Abra and Petruchio exiting the mini-mart. INT. TRUCK. AFTERNOON. CLOSE ON: Gregory. CLOSE ON: Sampson - Their singing abruptly halts. SAMPSON Here comes of the House of Capulet. EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON. Abra and Petruchio stare coldly toward the boys. INT. TRUCK. AFTERNOON. CLOSE ON: Sampson swallowing hard. CLOSE ON: Gregory; eyes locked to the Capulets. With fake bravado he nudges Sampson. GREGORY Quarrel I will back thee. CLOSE ON: Sampson trying to quell his rising panic. SAMPSON Let us take the law of our sides. Let them begin. SUDDENLY: BANG! Gregory and Sampson jump. WHIP PAN: It was the garage attendant slamming the hood. Gregory and Sampson are mortally embarrassed. EXT. MINI-MART. AFTERNOON. Abra and Petruchio laugh contemptuously and move to their car: FOLLOW: The mother and kids exiting the mini-mart. SUPER FAST SCAN TRACK: To... INT. TRUCK. AFTERNOON. Sampson furiously tries to save face. SAMPSON I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them if they bear it. Sampson quickly bites his thumb toward Abra\\'s back as he gets into the sedan. INT. SEDAN. AFTERNOON. Abra\\'s eyes flick to the rear view mirror. E.C.U.: The rear view mirror; Sampson biting his thumb. EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON. Suddenly, a blood curdling screech of tires - the sedan, rubber burning, reverses full speed toward Sampson and Gregory. The mother in the station wagon brakes to avoid collision - a sports car shunts into her vehicle. Mother and children scream. Attendants scatter. The Capulet car shudders to a halt inches from the truck, blocking its path. INT. BLACK SEDAN. AFTERNOON. CLOSE ON: A scurry of limbs scrabbling across seats and reaching for door handles; EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON. Abra hauls Sampson from the truck. Gregory leaps out, Petruchio covers him. Abra slams Sampson against the side of the vehicle - then, goading him to go for his gun, screams: ABRA Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? Sampson\\'s shaking hand hovers - ready to draw. SAMPSON I do bite my thumb, sir. INT. STATION WAGON. AFTERNOON. CUT TO: The panicked mother in the station wagon. She motions her children to the floor. EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON. Customers run for cover. CLOSE ON: Abra: An hysterical rage; he shrieks: ABRA Do you bite you thumb at us, sir? SAMPSON (sweating, murmurs to Gregory) Is the law on our side if I say \"Ay\"? GREGORY No. INT. BATHROOM. AFTERNOON. CLOSE ON: The black cowboy boots, trousers down around them. The sound of a toilet flushing. PAN TO: The next cubicle, the door opens revealing Benvolio. EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON. CLOSE ON: Sampson, still sweating. SAMPSON No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir - but I do bite my thumb, sir! CUT TO: Gregory; a ridiculous inquiry. GREGORY Do you quarrel, sir? CUT TO: Abra; a dangerous smile. ABRA Quarrel sir, no sir. CLOSE ON: Sampson; unconvincing bravado... SAMPSON But if you do, sir, I am for you. I serve as good a man as you. CLOSE ON: Abra; a lethal question. ABRA No better? CLOSE ON: Sampson, trapped. SAMPSON Well sir... INT. STATION WAGON. AFTERNOON. CUT TO: Inside the station wagon. The mother does not notice her five year old aiming a toy gun toward the boys. EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON. CUT TO: Gregory\\'s P.O.V.: Benvolio emerging from the bathroom - he whispers maniacally. GREGORY Here comes our kinsman. Say better! EXTREME CLOSE UP: Sampson; he screams: SAMPSON YES SIR, BETTER! EXTREME CLOSE UP: Abra demonically roars: ABRA THOU LIEST! CUT TO: Benvolio. Terror stricken, he sees the boys. DISTORTED OUT OF CONTROL CLOSE UP: Abra shrieks: ABRA DRAW IF YOU BE MEN! LIGHTNING CUT: Four hands reaching for guns. SLAM ZOOM: To Benvolio - weapon outstretched he screams: BENVOLIO Part, fools! You know not what you do! MUSIC STING; A SUPER MARCO SLAM ZOOM along the barrel of Benvolio\\'s gun; the engraved gun type reads: \\'Sword 9mm series S\\' CUT TO: Benvolio. He screams in desperation: BENVOLIO Put up your swords! Gregory, Sampson, Abra, and Petruchio freeze. A moment - then from behind, the unmistakable sound of a gun being cocked. EXTREME CLOSE UP: The black cowboy boots. CRANE UP: To find the dark cold eyes and feline smile, of the wearer of the boots. His name is TYBALT; a cigarette is clenched between his teeth and his gun is aimed at Benvolio\\'s head. TYBALT What, art thou drawn amoung these heartless hinds? Turn thee Benvolio. Benvolio, a choked explanation: BENVOLIO I do but keep the peace. A mocking smile. TYBALT Peace? I hate the word As I hate hell, all Montagues, and... EXTREME CLOSE UP: Tybalt\\'s finger squeezing the trigger... Suddenly we hear firing from Tybalt\\'s blind side. Tybalt redirects his weapon, cracking off a single shot at the surprise attacker. EXT./INT. MINIMART. AFTERNOON. It is the five year old from the station wagon. The bullet smacks the toy gun from the child\\'s hand, shattering the wagon\\'s window. Mother and children scream. EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON. A panicked Benvolio falls back, accidentally his gun fires - the bullet whistles past Tybalt\\'s head. Tybalt combat rolls, and using a screaming car load of girls as cover, returns two quick shots, narrowly missing Benvolio. EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON. The gas station attendant hits a button and heavy metal screens slam down. EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON. CUT TO: Gregory firing - a bullet rips through Abra\\'s arm. Petruchio dives for cover; Gregory and Sampson leap into Benvolio\\'s truck. Rubber burns as they smash past the Capulet vehicle. CLOSE ON: Tybalt taking aim. EXT. HIGHWAY - SUPERMARKET. AFTERNOON. His first shot plugs the fuel tank, the second a tire. Out of control and spewing gasoline the Montague truck careens across the highway and through the glass front of a supermarket. Gregory and Sampson throw themselves from the truck moments before... EXT. SUPERMARKET. AFTERNOON. CLOSE ON: The gas tank erupts into an almighty fireball. The screen fills with flame: the following images combust in front of us: EXT. HIGHWAY - SUPERMARKET - FROM AIR. AFTERNOON. NEWS CHOPPER P.O.V.: Citizens run in the streets. Looters raid shops near the supermarket - security guards return fire. INT. RESTAURANT. NIGHT. A table of dark suited men and their wives. CLOSE ON: The powerful 60 year old face of FULGENCIO CAPULET. Seated next to him is his much younger wife GLORIA. SUDDENLY: Windows explode in a tidal wave of glass. Diners take cover. Capulet moves fearlessly toward the window. CAPULET (to a waiter) Give me my long sword! EXT. STREET. NIGHT. CLOSE ON: The word MONTAGUE fills the screen. PULL BACK: We see the word is the number plate of a large black limousine. The limousine is stuck in the traffic snarl - bullets bounce off its bullet proof windshield. INT. MONTAGUE\\'S LIMOUSINE. NIGHT. TED MONTAGUE, a 60 year old red-faced bulldog of a man, bursts from the back of the limousine. MONTAGUE What noise is this! As Ted draws an enormous pearl handed revolver, CAROLINE, his conservatively dressed wife, tries to restrain him. CAROLINE Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe! MONTAGUE (shrugging her off) Hold me not, let me go! EXT. STREET. NIGHT. Crouched behind a truck, Benvolio shakily tries to re-load. CLOSE ON: The barrel of Tybalt\\'s gun enters frame and presses into Benvolio\\'s forehead. Tybalt whispers sweetly. TYBALT Look upon thy death, Benvolio. CLOSE ON: Tybalt\\'s finger on the trigger. Benvolio screams a scream of mortal horror. SUDDENLY Tybalt is blinded by a burning shaft of light. A magnificently powerful helicopter gunship hovers above him. A command booms from the chopper\\'s public address system. CAPTAIN PRINCE (over PA) Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace, Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground. INT. CHOPPER. NIGHT. CLOSE ON: The steely gray eyes of CAPTAIN PRINCE, chief of the Verona Beach Police Department. He lifts the microphone and repeats the command. CAPTAIN PRINCE Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground! EXT. VERONA BEACH. NIGHT. Tybalt looks up to the chopper. Patrol cars screech to a halt. An almighty orchestral chord. EXT. VERONA BEACH - MATTE SHOT. NIGHT. SUPER WIDE SHOT: A trail of devastation winds up through grid-locked traffic to the burning supermarket. In the distance looms an enormous statue of Christ flanked by two glass towers. We push toward the towers. One is neon-crowned MONTAGUE, the other, CAPULET. We hear: VOICE OVER Two households, both alike in dignity. In fair Verona, where we lay our scene From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star crossed lovers take their life. Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Doth with their death bury their parents strife. A dark chord. EXT. VERONA BEACH SKYLINE. NIGHT. A swarm of helicopters thunder into frame. We see compressed, time-lapsed, images of their journey. SLAM INTO: A coat of arms that labels a large tower - the emblem reads; \"Verona Beach Police Department: In God We Trust\". HOLD: INT. CAPTAIN PRINCE\\'S PRECINCT OFFICE. NIGHT. CLOSE ON: Captain Prince\\'s grim features. He eyes Capulet and Montague. CAPTAIN PRINCE Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word By thee, old Capulet, and Montague, Have thrice disturbed the quiet of our streets. Capulet\\'s lawyer tries to intervene. LAWYER My noble Prince I can... Captain Prince overriding, slams the desk. CAPTAIN PRINCE If ever you disturb our streets again, Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace. Hold on Captain Prince\\'s determined gaze. EXT. VERONA STREET. DAWN. A majestic sunrise; Ted Montague\\'s limousine sulks through deserted streets. In the distance, Jesus looks out over the now peaceful city. INT. MONTAGUE\\'S LIMOUSINE. DAWN. Ted Montague, his wife Caroline, and nephew Benvolio ride in uncomfortable silence. Caroline finally speaks her anger. CAROLINE O where is Romeo? Saw you him today? (pointedly to Montague) Right glad I am he was not at this fray. Montague snorts derisively and stares out the window. Embarrassed, Benvolio tries to be of assistance. BENVOLIO Madam, underneath The Grove of Sycamore So early walking did I see your son. Ted Montague speaks with contempt. MONTAGUE Many a morning hath he there been seen With tears augmenting the fresh morning\\'s dew. Caroline struggles to contain her emotion. CAROLINE Away from light steals home my heavy son And private in his chamber pens himself, Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out And makes himself an artificial night. Montague barks into the car intercom. MONTAGUE Westward from this city side. EXT. STREET. DAWN. The limousine U-turns heading west. EXT. BEACH. DAWN. To the melancholic strains of Mozart\\'s \"Serenade for Winds\", we see a blond nineteen year old boy sitting alone on an empty beach. CLOSE ON: The boy, ROMEO. Looking out over the ocean he sucks on the last of a cigarette and then writes intensely in a small worn note book. We hear his voice over. ROMEO (V/O) Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs; Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers\\' eyes; Being vexed, a sea nourished with lovers\\' tears. What is it else? A madness most discreet, A choking gall and a preserving sweet. INT. MONTAGUE\\'S LIMOUSINE. DAWN. The limo is parked in a cross street that runs down to the beach. Opposite the limo, young diehard clubbers, faded drag queens and street people, hang outside a dilapidated nightclub. A broken neon sign reads: \"The Grove of Sick Amore.\" Ted, Caroline and Benvolio sit watching the silhouette of Romeo on the beach. MONTAGUE Black and portentous must this humour prove Unless good counsel may the cause remove. EXT. BEACH. DAWN. P.O.V.: From the limousine. Romeo rises and listlessly makes his way up the beach - seeing his father\\'s car he turns and heads for the path that hugs the beach front. INT. MONTAGUE\\'S LIMOUSINE. DAWN. BENVOLIO So please you step aside. I\\'ll know his grievance or be much denied. Benvolio clambers out of the limo. CLOSE ON: Montague, an encouraging smile. MONTAGUE Come Madam. Let\\'s away. EXT. STREET. DAWN. The limousine pulls away and Benvolio heads after Romeo. He pauses. A deck at the rear of \"Sick Amore\" sprawls onto the beach. At the base of the deck, Benvolio can see Romeo squatting in discussion with an old drunk. Benvolio approaches with a not very convincing casualness. BENVOLIO Good morrow, cousin. Romeo turns. Sore, red, unfriendly eyes squint back at Benvolio. ROMEO Is the day so young? BENVOLIO But new struck, Coz. Romeo rises, Benvolio follows. ROMEO Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Romeo stops as if taking in Benvolio for the first time. ROMEO (CONT.) Was that my father that went hence so fast? BENVOLIO (guilty) It was. Benvolio chases Romeo down the path which divides the beach from a string of cheap souvenir shops and sleazy bars. BENVOLIO What sadness lengthens Romeo\\'s hours? ROMEO Not having that which having makes them short. BENVOLIO In love? ROMEO Out. BENVOLIO Of love? ROMEO Out of her favor where I am in love. BENVOLIO Alas that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannical and rough in proof! ROMEO Alas that love, whose view... Romeo is halted by the sight of last night\\'s disturbance displayed on a small TV screen in an outdoor bar. ROMEO (CONT.) What fray was here? Benvolio starts to reply. ROMEO (CONT.) (angrily) Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here\\'s much to do with hate, but more with love. Romeo turns the corner away from the beach. He strides along the sidewalk raging. ROMEO (CONT.) Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness, serious vanity, Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms, Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health, Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is! Romeo screams at a huge bouncer who lounges in the doorway of a sex club. ROMEO (CONT.) This love feel I, that feel no love in this! The bouncer\\'s hand moves to his gun. Romeo, ignoring him, turns on Benvolio. A mocking laughter through tears: ROMEO (CONT.) Dost thou not laugh? Benvolio, nervously eyeing the bouncer, shepherds Romeo out of danger. BENVOLIO No, coz, I rather weep. Romeo smiles. ROMEO Farewell, my coz. Romeo, breaking into a jog, leaves Benvolio behind. Benvolio pursues him down the street. EXT. ROMEO\\'S CAR. DAY. CLOSE ON: The sleeping face of a fourteen year old boy - BALTHASAR. PULL BACK: Balthasar sleeps on the hood of a magnificent silver car. Three or four kids doze on the sidewalk. As Romeo approaches, they jump up and begin vigorously polishing the already gleaming car. Balthasar wakes. He springs off the hood, chases the kids away, then, producing a huge bunch of keys, opens the car door for Romeo. Benvolio intercepts Romeo at the car. BENVOLIO Tell me in sadness, who is it that you love. ROMEO In sadness, cousin, I do love...a woman. BENVOLIO I aimed so near when I supposed you loved. Romeo leans against the car. ROMEO A right good marksman; and she\\'s fair I love. Romeo pulls his shirt down to reveal a small shoulder tattoo. CLOSE ON: The tattooed word; ROSALINE. BENVOLIO Rosaline! (he is impressed) A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit. ROMEO She\\'ll not be hit with Cupid\\'s arrow. She hath Dian\\'s wit, And in strong proof of chastity lives well armed. Benvolio can\\'t believe it. BENVOLIO Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste? ROMEO She hath; and in that sparing makes huge waste. Benvolio - a plan. BENVOLIO Be ruled by me; forget to think of her. ROMEO O, teach me how I should forget to think! Benvolio indicates one of the working girls already strutting the foot path. BENVOLIO By giving liberty unto thine eyes. Examine other beauties. Romeo laughs dismissively. He throws the kids a few coins and slides into the drivers seat. Balthasar jumps in back. ROMEO Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget. BENVOLIO I\\'ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt. Benvolio leaps into the passenger seat of the moving vehicle. INT. CAPULET OFFICE. DAY. An orchestral fanfare. TRACK DOWN: Past monstrous letters that read CAPULET and in through a window to discover Fulgencio Capulet. He stares out the window toward the other tallest building in Verona; the one crested with the word MONTAGUE. CAPULET But Montague is bound as well as I, In penalty alike; Capulet turns: on the other side of his desk sits DAVID PARIS; a square-jawed young man in a red cashmere sweater. Tea has been served from an exquisite silver tea service. CAPULET (CONT.) And \\'tis not hard, I think, for me so old as we to keep the peace. Dave smiles obligingly. DAVE Of honorable reckoning are you both, And pity \\'tis you lived at odds so long. An awkward pause: Dave sips tea, then, with a deep breath... DAVE (CONT.) But now, my lord, what say you to my suit? Capulet considers the framed photograph on his desk. CAPULET But saying o\\'er what I have said before; My child is yet a stranger in the world; Let two more summers wither in their pride, Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride. Dave is politely insistent. DAVE Younger than she are happy mothers made. CAPULET (checking him hard) And too soon marred are those so early made. Earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she; She is the hopeful lady of my earth. Capulet rounds the desk and places a fatherly hand on Dave\\'s shoulder. CAPULET (CONT.) But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart. My will to her consent is but a part, And she agreed, within her scope of choice Lies my consent and fair according voice. This night I hold an old Accustomed feast. Capulet leans close. CAPULET (CONT.) At my poor house, look to behold this night, Fresh female buds that make dark heaven light. Hear all; all see, And like her most whose merit most shall be. Capulet smiles knowingly. Dave seems encouraged. CAPULET (CONT.) (a hearty slap) Come go with me! Capulet excitedly ushers Dave from the office. INT. POOL HALL. DAY. Dim, smoke filled. Benvolio and Romeo play pool. BENVOLIO (chalking his cue) Take thou some new infection to thy eye. He lines up the six ball top pocket. BENVOLIO (CONT.) And the rank poison of the old will die. A hopeless shot that slams the eight ball toward the side pocket. Romeo stops it with his hand and hurls it against the other balls. BENVOLIO Why, Romeo, art thou mad? Romeo sinks the other balls with his hands. ROMEO Not mad, but bound more than a madman is; Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Romeo stalks away from the table. ROMEO (CONT.) Whipped and tormented. He stops at the gun check, rummaging in his pocket. ROMEO Good day, good fellow. A crusty old man looks up from the small television. His entire face a tattooed shooting target, the bullseye between his eyes. The old man points to the sign that reads: \"No ticket no gun.\" Romeo finally produces a ticket. Crusty the Target goes out back. Romeo\\'s attention is caught by the television. INT. T.V. STUDIO SET. DAY CUT TO: TELEVISION. An ostentatious woman and her over groomed partner Rich, hosts what looks to be a kind of Entertainment Tonight show. The graphic behind them reads \"Solemnity Nights\" with Susan Santandiago and Rich Ranchidis. Susan speaks conspiratorially to camera. SUSAN Now I\\'ll tell you without asking. The great Rich Capulet, holds an old accustomed feast; Rich chimes in: RICH A fair Assembly. SUSAN I Pray you sir can you read? A list of names begins to scroll across the screen. Rich reads them off. RICH Signor Placentio and his wife and daughters, Signor Martino, the Lady Widow Of Utruvio and her lovely nieces, Rosaline and Livia... INT. POOL HALL. DAY. CUT TO: Benvolio, he leans into Romeo. BENVOLIO At this same ancient feast of Capulet\\'s Sups the fair Rosaline; whom thou so loves, With all the admired beauties of Verona. Go thither, and with unattained eye Compare her face with some that I shall show, And I will make thee think thy swan a crow. ROMEO One fairer than my love? Crusty returns. He hands the boys their guns. ROMEO (CONT.) The all-seeing sun Ne\\'er saw her match since first the world begun. CUT TO: TELEVISION. SUSAN If you be not of the house of Montagues, Come and crush a cup of wine! RICH Rest you merry! CUT TO: Romeo, he considers. ROMEO I\\'ll go along, no such sight to be shown. But to rejoice in splendour of mine own. The boys move off. PUSH IN ON: THE TELEVISION. EXT. CAPULET STATE. DAY. An aerial shot of a magnificent island estate. An Italianate wonder of Florentine architecture. Armed guards patrol the grounds. The telecaption reads \"Capulet Mansion.\" The file tape loses its television quality. We sweep down through manicured gardens, where workers prepare decorations for tonight\\'s celebrations, and into the house. The music darkens and we hear the desperate calling of a girl\\'s name. VOICE OVER J U L I E T ! INT. CAPULET MANSION - CORRIDOR. DAY. CUT TO: A long deserted corridor. VOICE OVER J U L I E T ! INT. CAPULET MANSION - DRAWING ROOM. DAY. CUT TO: An echoey Chinoiserie style drawing room. VOICE OVER J U L I E T ! INT. BATHROOM. DAY. CLOSE ON: The still, serene, submerged features of a beautiful young girl. Dark floating hair gently frames the face. Heavy liquid eyes stare up through the water. We hear, though faintly, the calling: VOICE OVER J U L I E T ! With a rush JULIET surfaces. As she gulps air, we realise that she is in fact, in a bath. We hear the calling loudly again. VOICE OVER J U L I E T ! Juliet listens. For a moment she is very still, then she closes her eyes and slides back beneath the surface of the water. INT. ENTRANCE HALL CAPULET MANSION. DAY. A Gothic, unfriendly environment heavy with religious iconography. The entrance hall is crowded with workers and servants preparing for tonight\\'s party. Gloria Capulet fiddles with a short black wig in the hallway mirror. She is attired in full Cleopatra costume. Dissatisfied with the wig, she rips it from her head and calls maniacally. GLORIA J U L I E T ! Gloria is met by the NURSE, a fat, grandmotherly Hispanic woman. GLORIA (CONT.) Nurse, where\\'s my daughter? Call her forth to me. NURSE I bade her come. God forbid! Where\\'s this girl? Juliet! CUT TO: The top of the stairs. As if from nowhere, Juliet has appeared. She wears a bathrobe and her hair is wet. JULIET (coolly) Madam, I am here. What is you will. Gloria, startled, sweeps up the stairs and shuffles her daughter toward a doorway. GLORIA Nurse, give leave awhile, we must talk in secret. INT. GLORIA\\'S DRESSING ROOM. DAY. Gloria shepherds Juliet into her opulent dressing room and closes the door. She circles with nervous vexation searching for words, stops, then suddenly opens the door and yells out to the Nurse. GLORIA (CONT.) Nurse, come back again. I have remembered me, thou\\'s hear our counsel. The Nurse enters. Gloria, still refusing eye contact, checks her appearance once more in the mirror. She takes a hairbrush and, feigning pleasantness, intensely brushes her hair. GLORIA (CONT.) Nurse, thou knowest my daughter\\'s of a pretty age. NURSE (to Juliet) Thou wast the prettiest babe that e\\'er I nursed. The hair brush clatters onto the dresser. A moment of tense silence. Gloria grips herself and pours a sherry. Back still turned, she speaks to her daughter. GLORIA By my count, I was your mother much upon these years That you are now a maid. A nembutal twists like a pin in the corner of Gloria\\'s mouth. She slugs it down with the sherry and turns abruptly to face Juliet. GLORIA (CONT.) Thus then in brief, the valiant Paris seeks you for his love. CUT TO: Juliet; an uncomprehending stare. The Nurse, caught off guard, tries to buoy the situation. NURSE A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world - why, he\\'s a man of wax. The medication takes immediate effect upon Gloria. She joins Juliet on the couch and coos in Paris\\'s favour. GLORIA Verona\\'s summer hath not such a flower. NURSE Nay, he\\'s a flower; in faith, a very flower. GLORIA This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o\\'er the volume of young Paris\\' face And find delight writ there with beauty\\'s pen. This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him only lacks a cover. So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less. Gloria probes Juliet\\'s thoughts. GLORIA Can you like of Paris\\' love? Juliet, adept at negotiating her mother\\'s strange moods, chooses her words precisely. JULIET I\\'ll look to like, if looking liking move, But no more deep will I endart mine eye, Than your consent gives strength to make it fly. PETER the chauffeur enters. PETER Madam. The guests are come. GLORIA (checks the mirror) We follow thee. She exits, Nurse in tow. CLOSE ON: Juliet stares out the windows and across the water. Suddenly the Nurse\\'s face leers into shot. She whispers enthusiastically into Juliet\\'s ear. NURSE Go girl, seek happy nights to happy days. CLOSE ON: Juliet\\'s face. EXT. CAPULET MANSION. DAY/NIGHT. JUMP CUT: Aerial shot of Capulet Mansion. We time lapse from late afternoon to night; fairy lights illuminate, guests appear, music swells, and a single incandescent flare, explodes pink against the inky sky. EXT. BEACH. NIGHT. CLOSE ON: Romeo: his face glows pink. He is sitting on the grubby shoreline of Verona Bay dressed as a boy King Arthur, with fake chain mail and sword. Romeo watches the dying flare sink into the bay. The sound of the party drifts across the water. Balthasar, dressed as Frankenstein\\'s monster, touches a lighter to a large bong and Romeo inhales smoke. Behind them, Benvolio, drunk and dressed as a pizza, is yelling at Gregory, who, dressed as a Viking, is trying to cut slices off his pizza costume. Sampson, also dressed as a Viking, sits in the back of a car. One arm is bandaged and he swigs from a bottle. Suddenly the darkness is slashed by headlights. A reckless sports car speeds toward the boys. Stereo screaming, the car skids to a halt. CLOSE ON: Music blares from the sound system. A silver stilettoed foot emerges from the car and plants itself firmly in the dirt. CUT TO: The boys, eyes wide with amazement. CUT TO: Another stiletto follows the first. Guitar groans. PAN: Slowly up a shapely pair of black stockinged legs, past a hint of garter belt to a black sequined mini-skirt and up over a muscular dark skinned stomach and tiny sequined bra top, to discover: the 21 year old male, African American face of MERCUTIO. CUT TO: The boys. Recovering from the initial shock, they laugh and cat-call raucously. CUT TO: Mercutio. He roughly jams a short black wig onto his head and yells above the music. MERCUTIO Strike drum! Mercutio magically produces invitations from somewhere within his mini-skirt and dances down the beach to the boys. Aggressively bumping and grinding, Mercutio distributes the invitations. Reaching Romeo, he declares: MERCUTIO We\\'ll on without apology. Romeo lets the invitation fall to the sand. ROMEO I am not for this ambling. Being but heavy, I will bear the light. Romeo pulls on the bong once more. Suddenly, Mercutio is upon Romeo. Hauling him to his feet, he waltzes him through the sand. MERCUTIO Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance. Romeo pushes Mercutio away. ROMEO Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes With nimble soles. I have a soul of lead. Mercutio in mock sympathy. MERCUTIO Too great oppression for a tender thing. ROMEO Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn. Romeo lies staring up at the stars. MERCUTIO If love be rough with you, be rough with love. Mercutio jumps on Romeo. MERCUTIO (CONT.) Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down. Romeo fights Mercutio off. ROMEO Under love\\'s heavy burden do I sink! CUT TO: Benvolio, impatiently honking the horn. BENVOLIO Every man betake him to his legs! Mercutio heads Romeo toward the car. MERCUTIO Come, we burn daylight, ho! Romeo pulls away. ROMEO But \\'tis no wit to go. Mercutio turns, exasperated. MERCUTIO Why, may one ask? ROMEO I dreamt a dream tonight. MERCUTIO And so did I. ROMEO Well, what was yours? MERCUTIO That dreamers often lie. ROMEO In bed asleep, while they do dream things true. Mercutio produces a tiny gold pill case. MERCUTIO O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies\\' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate stone On the forefinger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men\\'s noses as they lie asleep. Tantalisingly, he passes the case beneath Romeo\\'s nose. MERCUTIO (CONT.) Her chariot is an empty hazelnut, Her wagoner a small gray-coated gnat. With a conjurer\\'s dexterity Mercutio extracts a small, gray pill. MERCUTIO (CONT.) And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers\\' brains, and then they dream of love; He palms the pills. It reappears from behind Romeo\\'s ear. MERCUTIO (CONT.) O\\'er lawyers\\' fingers who straight dream on fees; O\\'er ladies\\' lips, who straight on kisses dream, Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues. Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are. The pill box glints in the moonlight. MERCUTIO (CONT.) Sometime she driveth o\\'er a soldier\\'s neck; And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats. And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. Mercutio now intensely angry: MERCUTIO (CONT.) This is that very Mab That plaits the manes of horses in the night And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs He screams into the night. MERCUTIO (CONT.) This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage. This is she, this is she... CLOSE ON: Mercutio. He breaks off. There is a strange stillness amongst the group. Romeo goes to his friend. ROMEO Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace. Thou talkest of nothing. Mercutio meets Romeo\\'s gaze. MERCUTIO True, I talk of dreams; Which are the children of an idle brain, Begot of nothing but vain fantasy. Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind, who woos Even now the frozen bosom of the north And, being angered, puffs away from thence Turning his attention to the dew- dropping south. CUT TO: Benvolio in the car. The alcohol has caught up with him and he looks a little queasy. BENVOLIO This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves: Supper is done and we shall come too late. Romeo looks toward the distant city. ROMEO I fear, too early, for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night\\'s revels, and expire the term Of a despised life closed in my breast, By some vile forfeit of untimely death. PAUSE: The water turns golden as fireworks explode across the bay. Romeo smiles. ROMEO (CONT.) But he that hath the steerage of my course Direct my sail! He takes the pill and drops it into his mouth. ROMEO (CONT.) On, lusty gentlemen! With the rush of a mind altering cocktail, we ZOOM IN on Romeo\\'s eyes; they shimmer with the shooting star reflection of exploding fireworks - a bending Eastern chord, we launch into Donna Summer\\'s \\'I Feel Love\\', sung by the vocalist from Soundgarden with orchestration by \\'Deconstruction\\' and sitar by Ravi Shankar. EXT. MERCUTIO\\'S CAR - ON FREEWAY. NIGHT. PULL OUT: From Romeo\\'s eyes. He is lying in the passenger seat of Mercutio\\'s convertible as it rockets along the freeway. The camera is directly above Romeo. He stares up at the fireworks that reflect in the windshield. The car and freeway begin to rotate and the camera follows. We feel that the car is now travelling upside-down. The camera sways through a brilliant explosion of fireworks that fill the screen with a zillion pixilating, colored dots of fire. INT. CAPULET\\'S MANSION - BALLROOM. NIGHT. PULL OUT: To discover the glittering dots of fire refracting from the sparkling domed roof of the magnificently ornate Capulet Ballroom. The camera swoops down over bizarrely costumed revellers cavorting to a driving Latin big band. The camera partners with a drugged Mercutio and Benvolio who shamelessly caper with each other in a mock antic adagio. CUT TO: Romeo gazing blankly at the dance floor. CUT TO: Mercutio. He sweeps up a thirty-something sophisticate and twirls her in Romeo\\'s direction. MERCUTIO Everyman betake him to his legs! Romeo moves off through the crowd. CUT TO: ROMEO\\'S P.O.V.: Contorted images of costumed guests eat, drink and laugh in a grotesque collision of Yves Saint Laurent cocktail party and Bacchanalian romp. Suddenly a large arm coils around Romeo\\'s neck. DISTORTED EXTREME CLOSE UP: A seriously intoxicated Fulgencio Capulet; his puffy red face squeezes against Romeo\\'s. CAPULET Ah, I have seen the day that I could Tell a whispering tale in a fair ladies ear. Such as would please. Capulet screams above the music: CAPULET (CONT.) Come musicians play! Blood drums in Romeo\\'s ears. Breaking free from Capulet\\'s grasp as he pushes through the crowd toward the bathroom. INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT. Silent, underwater shot. Romeo\\'s tranquil features submerged in a basin of water. BEAT. With a gasp, Romeo rises. A moment. His breathing calms. Then, smoothing water into his hair, he gazes into the bathroom mirror. He turns: The entire wall opposite the mirror, is a magnificent salt- water fish tank. Romeo, drawn by it\\'s submarine beauty, leans against the fish tank. Applause echoes faintly through the bathroom speakers. INT. BALLROOM. NIGHT. As the applause dies, a dark-haired Latina Diva takes the spotlight. The band ease into the opening bars of a love ballad. INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT. As the music swells, Romeo watches a moustached catfish glide past a medieval castle. Suddenly, Romeo pulls away. Peering back at him through the castle is a pair of exquisitely beautiful angelic eyes. The Diva\\'s first pure, achingly beautiful notes soar. Confused, Romeo looks again. There is no mistake - it is a girl. Through a shimmering curtain of ribbon weed, two dark wide eyes, a childish nose and sumptuous full lips. Romeo pushes his face closer to the glass. The other face snaps abruptly away. INT. POWDER ROOM. NIGHT. CUT TO: Juliet, dressed as an angel, on the other side of the tank. We now realise that the girls\\' powder room and the boys\\' bathroom are divided by this watery wonder world. Juliet warily moves closer to the glass. INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT. Romeo leans his face against the glass. The love ballad builds. SLOW TRACK: From Romeo\\'s profile, in through the water, and... INT. POWDER ROOM. NIGHT. ...out the other side, to find Juliet in profile, peering into the tank. INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT. Romeo presses his nose lightly against the glass. INT. POWDER ROOM. NIGHT. Juliet; a tiny smile. Suddenly, CRASH! The door slams open. Juliet turns, startled. It is the Nurse. NURSE Juliet, your mother calls. The Nurse bustles Juliet out the door. Juliet looks over her shoulder at the mystery boy. INT. BALLROOM. NIGHT. Romeo, now without his mask, slams out of the bathroom - Juliet and the Nurse have disappeared into the crowd. CUT TO: Juliet being dragged along by the Nurse. She glances back toward the mystery boy, but he is gone. Juliet and the Nurse rejoin Dave Paris, who is dressed as an astronaut, and Gloria, at the side of the dance floor. Dave, irresistible smile, extends his hand to Juliet. DAVE Will you now deny to dance? Juliet looks to Dave, desperately searching for a reason to decline. Gloria, brushing aside her silly daughter\\'s protests, slugs the last of her champagne and corrals them onto the dance floor. GLORIA (whispering to Juliet) A man, young lady, such a man. As Juliet is dragged onto the floor her eyes furtively search for the boy. CUT TO: Romeo in the crowd. Desperate to find the girl, he roughly shunts aside a reveller dressed as Lucifer, Prince of Darkness. HOLD ON: Lucifer. He removes his mask: it is Tybalt. He turns to Abra, who\\'s dressed as a demon. TYBALT What, dares the slave come hither to fleer and scorn at our solemnity? Now by the stock and honor of my kin To strike him dead I hold it not a sin. Tybalt moves off aggressively, but is halted as Capulet slams a hand into his chest. CAPULET Why how now kinsman, wherefore storm you so? TYBALT Uncle, this is that villain Romeo. A Montague, our foe. Capulet peers across the ballroom. CAPULET Young Romeo is it? TYBALT \\'Tis he. CAPULET Content thee gentle coz, let him alone. I would not for the wealth of all this town Here in my house do him disparagement. Therefore be patient; take no note of him. Tybalt can\\'t believe it. TYBALT I\\'ll not endure him. CLOSE ON: Capulet, exploding with rage. CAPULET He shall be endured! (slapping Tybalt viciously) What, goodman boy! I say he shall! Go to. Capulet violently shoves Tybalt to the ground. CAPULET You\\'ll make a mutiny among my guests! A middle aged couple look on shocked - Capulet waves to them festively: CAPULET What? Cheerly my hearts! Capulet snorts at Tybalt in disgust. CAPULET You\\'ll not endure him! Am I the master here or you? Go to. Smoothing his hair into place, Capulet turns back into the ballroom. CLOSE ON: Tybalt choking back tears of rage. CUT TO: Romeo moving through the crowd. For a moment the crush clears and he spies the Angel on the dance floor. CLOSE ON: Romeo whispers: ROMEO Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight. For I ne\\'er saw true beauty till this night. Romeo begins to circumnavigate the dance floor in an attempt to get closer to Juliet. CUT TO: Dave slow dancing with Juliet. Juliet\\'s eyes search the room for the boy. CLOSE ON: Romeo. CLOSE ON: Juliet. Their eyes connect. Juliet looks quickly back to Dave who, oblivious, returns his most devastating smile. CUT TO: The songstress, her voice soars. CUT TO: Juliet. Unable to look away from the boy, she stares over Dave\\'s shoulder. CUT TO: Romeo. Ignoring the danger, he continues to move toward the Angel. With the Diva\\'s spiralling final notes, the ballad concludes. A complete black out. As the crowd break into wild applause, Juliet\\'s eyes search the darkness, but the boy is gone. The crowd cheers and screams its applause. An avalanche of balloons, tinsel and confetti rains down from the roof; swathes of red silk drop from the ceiling and the space is transformed. CLOSE ON: Juliet, searching for the boy. Suddenly: A gasp, Juliet\\'s eyes widen, shocked. In the dark, a hand has shot out from the drape curtaining off the stage and clasped hers. Juliet barely dares breathe. She glances furtively to Dave Paris - he watches the stage. Slowly Juliet turns toward the hand; there through a break in the curtain she can see eye, cheek and lips of the mystery boy. As the Diva reprises the chorus, Romeo gently pulls Juliet behind the curtain. INT. BEHIND CURTAIN. NIGHT. Concealed from the party by the red velvet drape, hands still clasped, the teenagers are so close their bodies almost touch. ROMEO If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this. My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss. Romeo moves his lips toward Juliet\\'s. She stops him. JULIET Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this. For saints have hands that pilgrim\\'s hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers\\' kiss. ROMEO Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too? JULIET (a gentle scolding) Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer. ROMEO O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do, They pray: grant thou, lest faith turn to despair. JULIET Saints do not move, though grant for prayer\\'s sake. ROMEO Then move not while my prayer\\'s effect I take. He kisses her. ROMEO (CONT.) Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purged. JULIET Then have my lips the sin that they have took. ROMEO Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again. He kisses her. JULIET You kiss by th\\' book. They kiss again. Suddenly a harsh light falls across the entwined couple. They break apart - Nurse has pulled open the curtain and stands eyeing them severely. NURSE Madam, your mother craves a word with you. We see that the party is breaking up. But for groups of die-hard revellers, the room is nearly empty. NURSE (CONT.) Come, let\\'s away. She takes firm control of her charge. Juliet furtively motions for the startled Romeo not to follow as he trails them across the room. CUT TO: ROMEO\\'S P.O.V.: The Nurse and Juliet reach the door, but instead of leaving, they turn and ascend the staircase that arcs around to the mezzanine level. They join a vexed Gloria Capulet who clings to a patient Dave Paris. Inaudible words are exchanged. Juliet flickers her eyes nervously to Romeo. CUT TO: Romeo. He halts at the foot of the stairs unsure. CUT TO: Gloria. Catching Juliet\\'s interest in the boy, she indicates to her daughter to \\'COME ALONG\\'. CUT TO: Romeo; a dawning realisation. ROMEO (under his breath) Is she a Capulet? CUT TO: Juliet. She stops and turns back. CUT TO: Romeo, comprehending the reality of who she is. CUT TO: Juliet. The Nurse whispers in her ear. NURSE His name is Romeo, and a Montague, The only son of your great enemy. An orchestral treatment of Joy Division\\'s \"Love will tear us Apart\" swells; HOLD ON: Juliet. Like a cloud passing across the sun, a dark coldness descends upon her. CUT TO: Mercutio. He throws himself upon the shell shocked Romeo. MERCUTIO Away, begone, the sport is at its best. Mercutio shuttles Romeo toward the door. ROMEO Ay so I fear, A covert glance over his shoulder. ROMEO (CONT.) The more is my unrest. EXT. CAPULET MANSION. NIGHT. Mercutio bundles Romeo through the front door and down the stairs to the waiting getaway car. INT. CAPULET MANSION - STAIRS ALCOVE WINDOW - NIGHT. CUT TO: Juliet. Manoeuvred by the Nurse up the stairs, she breaks away and rushes to a tiny, windowed alcove. EXT. CAPULET MANSION - MAIN ENTRANCE. NIGHT. CUT TO: Mercutio\\'s convertible and its noisy confederacy joining the line of departing limos. A huge sign combusts into blinding fireworks that write in giant words \"CAPULET.\" As the convertible passes beneath the blazing words, Romeo turns. Through a deluge of falling sparks, he glimpses the mystery girl high up in the tower. EXT. CAPULET MANSION - WINDOW. NIGHT. CLOSE ON: Juliet leaning out of the tower window. Brilliant sparkles light in her eyes. PUSH IN: We hear her secret whisper: JULIET My only love, sprung from my only hate. Too early seen unknown, and known too late. Prodigious birth of love it is to me EXT. CAPULET MANSION - MAIN ENTRANCE DRIVE. NIGHT. CUT TO: JULIET\\'S P.O.V.: In slow motion Romeo, through the falling curtain of fiery embers. JULIET (CONT.)(V/O) That I must love a loathed enemy. EXT. CAPULET MANSION - WINDOW. NIGHT. Warm wind blows the smoke from the expended fireworks. Juliet closes the window and leans against the glass. CRANE DOWN: The side of the building past revellers who don\\'t know when to leave. Standing in the front doorway is someone else who cannot take their eyes off the departing Romeo. It is Tybalt. The music darkens as we push through the smoky wind. TYBALT I will withdraw. But this intrusion shall, Now seeming sweet, convert to bitterest gall. INT. MERCUTIO\\'S CAR. NIGHT. Caught in the jam of departing vehicles, Mercutio\\'s car crawls along the bridge that links Capulet island with the mainland. The boys sing along raucously with the radio. BOYS \"I am a pretty piece of flesh, I am a pretty piece of flesh...\" PUSH IN: On Romeo, he whispers: ROMEO Can I go forward when my heart is here? Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out. Romeo leaps from the car. Benvolio yells after him. BENVOLIO Romeo! Cousin Romeo! Romeo! EXT. CAPULET BRIDGE. NIGHT. Romeo runs back along the bridge toward the estate. At the gates, armed guards supervise the exodus of vehicles. Romeo uses the traffic to shield himself from view. Romeo leaps from the bridge and into the shadows at the base of the high stone wall that borders the compound. EXT. CAPULET BRIDGE. NIGHT. Mercutio\\'s car prowls back along the bridge. The last guests have departed and the gates are swinging shut. The convertible halts in front of them. BENVOLIO He ran this way. Call, good Mercutio. MERCUTIO Nay, I\\'ll conjure too. Mercutio leaps from the car. He postures like a magician in a low-budget variety special. The boys cheer him on. MERCUTIO Romeo! Humours! Madman! Passion! Lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline\\'s bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh. And the demesnes that there adjacent lie, That in thy likeness thou appear to us! EXT. CAPULET WALL. NIGHT. CLOSE ON: Romeo\\'s fake chain mail shirt tangled in the barbed wire at the top of the wall. PAN DOWN: Romeo, now on the other side of the wall, pulls up his undershirt and gingerly inspects the cuts inflicted by the wire. Mercutio\\'s cavorting echoes from the bridge. Romeo smiles ironically. ROMEO He jests at scars that never felt a wound. Romeo moves off through the darkened grounds of Capulet estate. EXT. CAPULET BRIDGE. NIGHT. The boys laugh hysterically as Mercutio staggers around the bridge in imitation of a love sick fool. MERCUTIO O Romeo, that she were, O that she were An open-arse and thou a poperin pear! The hilarity is abruptly arrested as a security spotlight blazes to life, pinning Mercutio in its beam. The sound of automatic weapons cocking pierces the night. CLOSE ON: Mercutio. He\\'s brave but not stupid. He gets back into the car. MERCUTIO (CONT.) Come, shall we go? EXT. THE BACK OF CAPULET MANSION. NIGHT. CLOSE ON: A pair of stone cherubs on top of the retaining wall of a terraced garden. Romeo\\'s face appears between them. Romeo hauls himself up onto the wall. Below is a Greco- Roman style pool area. To the right the darkened rear wing of Capulet Mansion. Suddenly the back of the house explodes with light. Romeo takes cover. ROMEO But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? Romeo\\'s question is answered as out onto the verandah comes Juliet. She is still clad in her angel robe, but without the halo and wings. She slowly descends to pool level. ROMEO It is the East, and Juliet is the sun! Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief That thou her maid art far more fair than she. Be not her maid, since she is envious. Her vestal livery is but sick and green, And none but fools do wear it. Juliet stands on the top step of the pool stairs. She is directly below Romeo as he whispers. ROMEO (CONT.) Cast it off! Juliet sits on the edge of the pool, her legs dangle in the water. ROMEO (CONT.) It is my lady. O, it is my love! O that she knew she were! Juliet sighs. JULIET Ay me! ROMEO (whispers) She speaks. O, speak again, bright angel! Juliet looks longingly toward the stars. JULIET O Romeo, Romeo! - Whyfore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name. Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I\\'ll no longer be a Capulet. CLOSE ON: Romeo. Incredulous. ROMEO Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this? JULIET \\'Tis but thy name that is my enemy. Thou are thyself, though not a Montague. What\\'s Montague? It is not hand nor foot Nor arm nor face nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What\\'s in a name? That which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet. So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name, And for thy name, which is no part of thee, Take all myself. Romeo wildly calls: ROMEO I take thee at thy word! Call me but love, and I\\'ll be new baptised. Henceforth I never will be Romeo. Romeo jumps down from the wall. Juliet screams, and turns, toppling backwards. Romeo grabs her hand but her momentum overbalances him and they both plunge headlong into the pool. EXT. CAPULET MANSION - POOL - UNDERWATER. NIGHT. Underwater shot: A slow motion phosphorescent tangle of arms, legs and bodies. EXT. CAPULET MANSION - BACK GARDEN. NIGHT. CUT TO: A security guard. Alerted by the noise he moves toward the pool area. EXT. CAPULET MANSION - POOL GARDEN - NIGHT. CUT TO: Above water, real time: Romeo and Juliet surface spluttering. Juliet thrashes the water in an attempt to get distance from her attacker. JULIET What man art thou that, thus bescreened in night, So stumblest on my counsel? Romeo: A calming gesture as he tries to tread water. ROMEO By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am: My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself Because it is an enemy to thee. The ferocious barking of a guard dog arrests the teenagers attention. A moment, then they slide beneath the water. CUT TO: The security guard and dog appearing above the pool area. GUARD\\'S P.O.V.: The rippling surface of the water. CUT TO - UNDERWATER SHOT: Romeo and Juliet submerged, hair streaming, stare at each other like two beautiful fish. CUT TO: The guard. He can see noisy caterers cleaning up around the other side of the house. Frowning, he returns the way he came. CUT TO: Romeo and Juliet. Gasping for air, they cautiously surface. A moment - then Juliet, a small smile. JULIET Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague? ROMEO Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike. Juliet looks nervously toward the house. She drags Romeo toward a small grotto at the end of the pool. JULIET How cam\\'st thou hither, tell me, and whyfore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art. ROMEO (with splashy bravado) With love\\'s light wings did I o\\'er perch these walls. For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do, that dares love attempt. Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me. Juliet drags Romeo firmly into the grotto. JULIET (a real fear) If they do see thee, they will murder thee. Romeo slowly pulls Juliet toward him. ROMEO I have night\\'s cloak to hide me from their eyes. And but thou love me, let them find me here. My life were better ended by their hate Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love. The lovers kiss long and deep. Then Juliet, suddenly fearful, pushes Romeo away. JULIET Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek, For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight. Fain would I dwell on form - fain, fain deny What I have spoke. But farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? Romeo tries to speak, Juliet silences him. JULIET (CONT.) I know thou wilt say \\'Ay\\', and I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swearest, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully. Or if thou think\\'st I am too quickly won, I\\'ll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay, So thou wilt woo. But else, not for the world. In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond, And therefore thou mayst think my \\'haviour light. But trust me, gentleman, I\\'ll prove more true Than those that have more cunning to be strange. ROMEO Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow, That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops - JULIET O, swear not by the moon, th\\' inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable. ROMEO What shall I swear by? JULIET Do not swear at all. Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I\\'ll believe thee. She touches his cheek. Romeo moves his lips close. ROMEO If my heart\\'s dear love - Confused, Juliet breaks away. JULIET Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract tonight. It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say \\'it lightens.\\' Sweet, good night. This bud of love, by summer\\'s ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. She rushes up the stairs - Romeo follows desperately. ROMEO O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied? Juliet - a shocked look. JULIET What satisfaction canst thou have tonight? CLOSE ON: Romeo. ROMEO The exchange of thy love\\'s faithful vow for mine. CLOSE ON: Juliet. She runs joyously to Romeo. JULIET I gave thee mind before thou didst request it! Kissing him passionately. JULIET (CONT.) And yet I would it were to give again. ROMEO Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what purpose love? JULIET But to be frank and give it thee again. They kiss again. The Nurse calls from inside. NURSE (O/S) Juliet! Juliet looks to the house. JULIET (breathlessly) Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable. Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow, By one that I\\'ll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite, And all my fortunes at thy foot I\\'ll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world. NURSE (O/S) Madam! JULIET I come, anon - But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee... NURSE (O/S) Madam! JULIET (to Nurse) By and by I come! To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief. Tomorrow will I send. Romeo holds Juliet\\'s gaze. ROMEO So thrive my soul. NURSE (O/S) Madam! Juliet breaks away. JULIET A thousand times good night! With a final kiss, Juliet runs inside. ROMEO A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books; But love from love, toward school with heavy looks. Juliet re-appears at the upper balcony. JULIET Romeo! What o\\'clock tomorrow Shall I send to thee? ROMEO By the hour of nine. Juliet unclasps a delicate silver necklace from around her neck. JULIET I will not fail. \\'Tis twenty year till then. Goodnight, goodnight! Parting is such sweet sorrow. That I shall say goodnight till it be morrow. She lets the necklace fall from her hand. Romeo catches it and she is gone. ROMEO Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast, Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest. INT. GREENHOUSE. DAWN. Morning sunlight filters through the lush foliage of a tropical rainforest. PAN DOWN: As we hear: FATHER LAURENCE (O/S) O mickle is the powerful grace that lies In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities. We discover the intensely concentrating features of FATHER LAURENCE. Fifties, wiry and wearing a priest\\'s collar, Laurence delicately makes an incision in the bulb of a small purple flowered plant. A pair of fresh faced ten year old boys look on in wonderment as a vivid blue sap oozes from the incision. FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.) Within the infant rind of this weak flower Poison hath residence, and medicine power. PULL BACK: The Priest carefully gathers the sap into a beaker. We discover that we are in a small tropical greenhouse. FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.) (to the boys) For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; Being tasted, stays all senses with the heart. The boys follow the Father as he moves out of the greenhouse and into an adjoining work area. The walls are lined with bottles of herbs and dried plants and a television flickers in the corner. FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.) For naught so vile on the earth doth live, But to the earth some special good doth give; With the precision of a chemist, Father Laurence funnels the sap into a small bottle and places it in the refrigerator. From out of the refrigerator he produces a large jar of candy. He eyes the boys sternly. FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.) Nor aught so good but, strained from that fair use, Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse. The boys take their candy and scram. CUT TO: The muted television. A morning news program shows footage of a murder scene cordoned off with police tape. A distraught mother is being restrained. CLOSE ON: The priest contemplating the television. FATHER LAURENCE Two such opposed kings encamp them still In man as well as herbs: grace and rude will; And where the worser is predominant, Full soon the canker death eats up that plant. A feverish knocking breaks the priest\\'s reverie. ROMEO (O/S) Good morrow, father! Father Laurence snaps off the television and exits the workroom. EXT. WALL. DAWN. Romeo, dressed in last night\\'s chain mail, pounds desperately on a wooden door set into a high stone wall. ROMEO Good morrow, father! EXT. COURTYARD. DAWN. From the workroom, Father Laurence enters a courtyard which encloses a tranquil tropical garden. He opens a door in the wall of the courtyard and smiles as the costumed Romeo bursts in. FATHER LAURENCE Benedicite! What early tongue so sweet saluteth me? Without pausing, the priest continues through the courtyard and toward the church. FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.) Young son, it argues a distempered head So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed. Or if not so, then here I hit it right - Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight. The priest enters the back of the church. INT. SACRISTY. DAWN. Romeo, on fire to tell of his experience, follows the priest into the sacristy. ROMEO The last is true. The sweeter rest was mine. FATHER LAURENCE (he stops) God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline? ROMEO With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No. I have forgot that name and that name\\'s woe. The Father lays out the cut glass bottles and communion tray for mass. FATHER LAURENCE That\\'s my good son! But where hast thou been then? Unconsciously, Romeo helps the priest prepare. It is clear he knows the routine by heart. ROMEO I have been feasting with mine enemy, Where on a sudden one hath wounded me. That\\'s by me wounded. Both our remedies Within they help and holy physic lies. FATHER LAURENCE (buttoning a long black cassock) Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift. Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift. ROMEO Then plainly know my heart\\'s dear love is set, On the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, and made exchange of vow, I\\'ll tell thee as we pass. But this I pray, That thou consent to marry us today. CUT TO: The Priest, thunderstruck. The two kids, now dressed in red altar-boy robes, enter. ALTAR BOYS Good morrow, Romeo. The apoplectic priest waves the boys away. They get the message and bolt. FATHER LAURENCE Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here! Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear, So soon foresaken? Young men\\'s love then lies Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes. ROMEO Thou chid\\'st me oft for loving Rosaline. FATHER LAURENCE (very angry) For doting, not for loving, pupil mine. ROMEO I pray thee chide me not. Her I love now Doth grace for grace and love for love allow. The other did not so. FATHER LAURENCE O, she knew well Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell. The Father falls into a chair and considers. He looks through the sacristy door to where a small children\\'s choir has assembled. Their angelic voices soar into the purest of hymns. CHOIR How can you just leave me standing Alone in a world so cold, Maybe I\\'m just too demanding, Maybe I\\'m just like my father, too bold, Maybe you\\'re just like my mother, She\\'s never satisfied. Why do we scream at each other? This is what it sounds like when doves cry... We recognise the hymn as \"When Doves Cry\" by Prince. PUSH IN: On the Priest; moved, he looks to Romeo. FATHER LAURENCE But come, young waverer, come, go with me. In one respect I\\'ll thy assistant be. For this alliance may so happy prove To turn your households\\' rancor to pure love. Romeo hurriedly assists the priest with his vestments. ROMEO O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste. Father Laurence holds Romeo in his powerful gaze. FATHER LAURENCE Wisely and slow. They stumble that run fast. The procession is joined by the two little altar boys and the mass begins. EXT. VERONA BEACH. DAY. As the Angelic voices of the choir soar, we see a pay phone etched with hyper-real starkness against the white sand, green sea and blue sky. A single leaning palm tree frames the image like a ridiculous tourist postcard. Benvolio speaks on the pay phone. Mercutio, torso naked but for his holstered Sports Rapier 9mm, drums his fingers on the side of the booth. MERCUTIO Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home tonight? BENVOLIO (slamming down the phone) Not to his father\\'s. I spoke with his man. Mercutio storms off down the beach. MERCUTIO Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, Torments him so that he will sure run mad. BENVOLIO (running to keep up) Tybalt hath sent a letter to his father\\'s house. MERCUTIO (halts abruptly) A challenge, on my life. CLOSE ON: Benvolio, unsure. BENVOLIO Romeo will answer it? MERCUTIO Any man that can write may answer a letter. BENVOLIO Nay, he will answer the letter\\'s master, how he dares, being dared. Mercutio clamps Benvolio into a headlock. MERCUTIO Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! Stabbed with a white wench\\'s black eye, He whispers into Benvolio\\'s ear: MERCUTIO (CONT.) Run through the ear with a love song. (in disgust) And is he a man to encounter Tybalt? BENVOLIO (struggling to break free) Why, what is Tybalt? MERCUTIO (releasing him) More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he\\'s the courageous captain of compliments. The very butcher of a silk button. Lightening fast, Mercutio draws his gun. He twirls it in an impressive display of gunmanship which ends with the barrel between the startled Benvolio\\'s eyes. MERCUTIO (CONT.) A duellist, a duellist. Romeo\\'s car pulls into the beach side parking lot. Benvolio heads toward it. BENVOLIO Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo! EXT. BEACH - PARKING LOT. DAY. Romeo alights from his car and throws his keys to Balthasar who lounges outside the beach side hang. Mercutio saunters up the beach with mock nonchalance. MERCUTIO Signor Romeo, Bonjour. There\\'s a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night. ROMEO Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you? MERCUTIO The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive? Romeo smiles smugly. ROMEO Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy. MERCUTIO (sarcastically) A most courteous exposition. ROMEO Nay I am the very pink of courtesy. MERCUTIO (camply) Pink for flower? The boys laugh. Romeo feigns anger. ROMEO I will bite thee on the ear for that jest! Mercutio, goading Romeo to follow, backs off down the beach. MERCUTIO Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits faint. Mercutio flicks sand at Romeo, then sprints off down the beach. Romeo, laughing, gives chase. ROMEO Switch and spurs, switch and spurs, or I\\'ll cry a match. EXT. BEACH - SHORELINE. DAY. Romeo is gaining on Mercutio, who runs headlong into the sea. With a yell, Romeo dives in after him. EXT. BEACH - AT SEA. DAY. Mercutio splashes the laughing Romeo. MERCUTIO Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Romeo tries to dunk Mercutio. MERCUTIO (CONT.) Now art thou sociable. Mercutio, evading, heads for shore. MERCUTIO (CONT.) Now art thou Romeo. Now art thou... EXT. BEACH - SHORELINE. DAY. Romeo tackles Mercutio on the wet sand. Mercutio falls suddenly serious. MERCUTIO (CONT.) (quietly) What thou art, by art as well as by nature. A moment between the boys. A shadow falls across them. Romeo looks up. ROMEO Here\\'s goodly gear. Standing above the boys is the Nurse. She wears a ridiculous, all red, \"Jackie O\" style disguise of sunglasses, scarf and parasol. MERCUTIO (bemused) God ye good e\\'en fair gentlewoman. The nurse, ignoring Mercutio, speaks dramatically to Romeo. NURSE I desire some confidence with you. She turns and walks back to the parking lot where Peter the chauffer waits beside the limousine. Benvolio and the other boys look on curiously. MERCUTIO A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho! But Romeo rises and to the amazement of Mercutio actually follows this woman. Mercutio looks questioningly to Benvolio, who shrugs. BENVOLIO She will endite him to some supper? Even more strangely, Romeo gets into the limousine. MERCUTIO (taken by surprise) Romeo, will you come to your father\\'s? We\\'ll to dinner thither. ROMEO (as he closes the door) I will follow you. MERCUTIO Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell. The car pulls away. EXT. STREET. DAY. The limousine drives through Verona Beach. INT. MOVING LIMOUSINE. DAY. CLOSE ON: Romeo jammed into the corner of the seat. The Nurse\\'s face is pressed alarmingly close to his. She speaks in cold deadly earnest. NURSE If ye should lead her in a fool\\'s paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say. For the gentlewoman is young; and therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing and very weak dealing. BEAT: Romeo chooses his words carefully. ROMEO Bid her to come to confession this afternoon, And there she shall at Friar Laurence\\'s cell Be shrived and (PUSH IN ON: Romeo) married. INT. JULIET\\'S BEDROOM. DAY. CLOSE ON: Juliet\\'s face peering out her bedroom window. JULIET O God she comes! EXT. CAPULETS MANSION - DRIVEWAY. DAY. PULL BACK: JULIET\\'S P.O.V.: The limousine pulls up at the front door, the Nurse alights. Juliet bolts from the room. INT. LANDING. DAY. Juliet hurries down the stairs - the Nurse, a way ahead, disappears into a doorway. INT. STAIRWAY. DAY. Juliet races down a dark stairwell that leads to the bowels of the house. INT. KITCHEN. DAY. The kitchen, obviously the Nurse\\'s domain, is decorated with a mixture of religious iconography and travel posters. Most of the posters depict a strange city of decadent, decaying, beauty. Juliet bursts breathlessly into the room. JULIET O honey nurse, what news? The Nurse, buried up to her ample hips inside the refrigerator, does not turn around. Juliet cries impatiently. JULIET Nurse! The nurse emerges from the ice box laden with food. Moving to the counter she starts to make a sandwich. NURSE I am aweary, give me leave awhile. Fie, how my bones ache. What a jaunce have I. Juliet under her breath. JULIET I would thou hadst my bones and I thy news. Juliet goes to the nurse. JULIET Nay come, I pray thee, speak: good; good Nurse, speak. Sandwich made, the nurse shuffles over to a corner couch. NURSE Jesu, what haste. Can you not stay awhile? Can you not see I am out of breath? Juliet cannot stand the suspense any longer. JULIET How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath! Is the news good or bad? Answer to that. The Nurse takes a big bite from her sandwich and answers through thoughtful chews. NURSE Well, you have made a simple choice. You know not how to choose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better than any man\\'s, yet his leg excels all men\\'s and for a hand and a foot and a body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare. He\\'s not the flower of courtesy, but I\\'ll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench, serve God. What, have you dined at home? Juliet is flabbergasted. JULIET No, no. But all this I did know before. What says he of our marriage? What of that NURSE Lord how my head aches! What a head have I: My back - This is a game that Juliet knows well. She moves behind the Nurse and begins massaging her back. NURSE (CONT.) o\\' t\\'other side - ah, my back! Beshrew your heart for sending me about To catch my death with jauncing up and down. With sublime self control, Juliet coo\\'s sweetly. JULIET I\\'faith I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what says my love? NURSE Your love says like an honest gentleman, And a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, And I warrant a virtuous - Where is your mother? Juliet cracks. JULIET Where is my mother? How oddly thou repliest! \\'Your love says, like an honest gentleman, \"Where is your mother\"\\'! The nurse sulks. NURSE O God\\'s lady dear are you so hot? Henceforth do your messages yourself. Juliet\\'s frustration explodes. JULIET Here\\'s such a coil! COME WHAT SAYS ROMEO? PAUSE: The Nurse considers Juliet. NURSE Have you got leave to go to confession today? JULIET I have. NURSE Then hie you hence to Father Laurence cell. There stays a husband to make you a wife! Juliet, with a scream of joy, hugs the Nurse to her. HOLD ON: Juliet\\'s ecstatic features. INT. CHURCH. DAY. TIGHT ON: FATHER LAURENCE: FATHER LAURENCE These violent delights have violent ends! PULL BACK: Father Laurence is preaching energetically from the pulpit. Hidden from the congregation, Romeo waits in a small alcove chapel at the side of the altar. FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.) The sweetest honey Is loathsome in its own deliciousness, Therefore love moderately. The Father glances toward Romeo. FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.) Long love doth so. Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow. Juliet pushes through the double doors at the far end of the church. Father Laurence motions to the middle-aged choir master who leads the choir into a choral version of Led Zeppelin\\'s \"A Whole Lot of Love\" with Latin lyrics. Father Laurence hurries from the altar over to Romeo. FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.) Here comes the lady. Juliet bursts into the tiny chapel. Trying to observe a vestige of decorum, she greets Father Laurence. JULIET Good afternoon to my ghostly confessor. But before the priest can reply, the two lovers embrace, kissing passionately. FATHER LAURENCE (dryly) Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both. The choir completes the hymn and the priest, realising it is his cue, rushes back to the altar. He quickly delivers a prayer to the congregation while eyeing the increasingly amorous smooching of the young couple. The choir launch into a joyous chorus and the priest returns to Romeo and Juliet. He delicately parts the couple. FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.) Come, come, and we will make short work. For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone Till Holy Church incorporate two in one. A young boy with a voice like Jamiroquai steps forward. He launches into a wailing solo. MACRO CLOSE UP: A simple silver ring. Engraved on the inside of the band are the words \\'I love thee.\\' PULL BACK: Romeo slips the ring onto Juliet\\'s finger as the priest executes the formal sacrament of marriage. INT./EXT. CHURCH. DAY. CRANE UP: Through the majestic patterning of stained glass, and out of the church to find Peter, the chauffeur, cradling a small camera as he waits nervously beside the limo. EXT. CHURCH. DAY. The music swells in celebration. Romeo and Juliet, now newly-wed, rush from the side door of the church. The priest follows, throwing handfuls of rice. Peter studiously takes a snap as the bride and groom kiss. Peter holds the door of the limousine open. Reluctantly Juliet gets into the car. As the car pulls out of the driveway, Romeo runs alongside. HOLD: On Romeo as he watches the big black car speed away. EXT. UNDERWATER. DAY. FISH-EYE VIEW: From the bottom of the ocean; Mercutio\\'s distorted features. Gun aimed, he stares intently into the water. A muffled BANG! and a bullet whizzes past the camera. EXT. VERONA BEACH. DAY. We see that Mercutio - wading in knee deep water close to the beach - is hunting fish. Benvolio shelters in the shade of an unmanned life guard tower. A shimmering heat haze blankets the deserted beach and the horizon is stacked with purple storm clouds. BENVOLIO I pray thee, good Mercutio, let\\'s retire. The day is hot, Mercutio, ignoring him, plugs away at another fish. Benvolio nervously looks to see if there is any reaction to the sound of the shot. BENVOLIO (CONT.) The Capels are abroad. And if we meet we shall not \\'scape a brawl. Mercutio strides out of the water. MERCUTIO Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and says \\'God send me no need of thee!\\' (he hands Benvolio his gun) and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need. Another incredible sleight of hand routine and Mercutio has managed to draw Benvolio\\'s pistol, retrieve his own gun, and trap Benvolio with a barrel at each temple. The joke has worn thin for Benvolio; he pushes past Mercutio toward where Balthasar, Sampson and Gregory lounge in the shade of the beach-side hang. Suddenly he stops dead - a monstrous black sedan prowls into the beach side parking lot. BENVOLIO By my head, here comes the Capulets. MERCUTIO By my heel, I care not. EXT. BEACH - PARKING LOT. DAY. The sedan mounts the curb and slides to a halt only metres from Benvolio and Mercutio. Tybalt, Abra and Petruchio alight from the sedan and walk menacingly toward Mercutio and Benvolio. TYBALT Gentlemen, good day. A word with one of you. The boys from the hang, drawn the Capulet car, converge - eyes dart nervously, hands stray towards guns. Mercutio smiles mockingly. MERCUTIO And but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a... Leaning close to Tybalt, he camps the implication. MERCUTIO (CONT.) ...blow. Mercutio scores. The boys laugh. TYBALT (furious) You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, (clutching at his side arm) And you will give me occasion. CLOSE ON: Mercutio. He stops, eyeing the hand on the gun. No one moves. MERCUTIO (a breathy, coquettish voice) Could you not take some occasion without giving? The boys fall about again. Tybalt cracks. TYBALT Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo. The accusation stings - Mercutio\\'s anger flares. MERCUTIO Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? And thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing but discords. Here\\'s my fiddlestick. Indicating his holstered gun. MERCUTIO (CONT.) Here\\'s that shall make you dance. (barking at Tybalt) Zounds, (goading him to go for his gun) consort! CLOSE ON: Tybalt. CLOSE ON: Mercutio. He will not back down. Benvolio tries to diffuse things. BENVOLIO Either withdraw unto some private place. Or reason coldly of your grievances. Here all eyes gaze on us. MERCUTIO Men\\'s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze. I will not budge for no man\\'s pleasure, I. At that moment, Romeo\\'s car pulls into the lot. Tybalt smiles. TYBALT Well sir, here comes my man. Tybalt moves toward Romeo who bounds from his car full of happy news. TYBALT Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford No better term than this: CLOSE ON: Tybalt. He clears his jacket from his side arm and issues the challenge. TYBALT (CONT.) Thou art a villain! CLOSE ON: Mercutio. CLOSE ON: Benvolio. All eyes are on Romeo. Romeo calmly approaches his now cousin. ROMEO Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee Doth much excuse the appertaining rage To such a greeting: villain am I none, Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not. Romeo turns, and to the amazement of all, walks back to his car. Tybalt, unable to shoot him in the back, is confused. He hurls himself into his sedan. Kicking it into a sand spraying U-turn, he careens the short distance to Romeo\\'s car. Slamming into the back of it he blocks Romeo in. Tybalt leaps out, maniacally kicking at bumper, door and headlights. Romeo flicks the locks down. Tybalt shatters the side window and hauls Romeo through the door, slamming him against the savaged fuselage. TYBALT Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries That thou hast done me! He smashes Romeo across the face, Romeo crashes to the roadway. TYBALT (yelling) Turn and draw. A cut has opened in the side of Romeo\\'s mouth. He unsteadily lifts himself up, and meeting Tybalt\\'s gaze, speaks through bloodied teeth. ROMEO I never injured thee, And so, good Capulet, which name I tender As dearly as mine own... Romeo cautiously extracts his gun... ROMEO (CONT.) ...be satisfied. ...and throws it at Tybalt\\'s feet. Storm clouds obscure the sun as Romeo turns and walks from the parking lot. Mercutio, Benvolio and the others cannot believe their eyes. MERCUTIO O calm, dishonourable, vile submission! EXT. BEACH - VACANT LOT. DAY. Tybalt\\'s anger must be answered. He ceremoniously disarms, gives his weapon to Abra, and sprints after Romeo who is now passing a beach side lot that houses an abandoned grand hotel. A bone-cracking kick sends Romeo crumbling into the vacant lot. The boys swarm toward the fray. Romeo, still refusing the fight, scrambles up the stairs of the deserted hotel. Tybalt trips him and Romeo careens into an ornamental wooden railing, smashing it to pieces. Tybalt kicks savagely at the helpless Romeo. Suddenly, Mercutio appears running full tilt down the concrete terrace. He plucks up one of the splintered wooden palings and yells... MERCUTIO (CONT.) Tybalt, you ratcatcher, ...as he bludgeons him across the face. Tybalt goes down. MERCUTIO (CONT.) Will you walk? Tybalt leaps to his feet grabbing a lump of wood. TYBALT What wouldst thou have with me? He swipes at Mercutio. MERCUTIO (avoiding) Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives. Mercutio jabs, Tybalt sidesteps. TYBALT I am for you. Tybalt aims a double-handed blow to Mercutio\\'s head. Mercutio blocks, hooking Tybalt\\'s stick away. Unarmed, Tybalt throws his full body weight upon Mercutio, slamming him against a window that shatters in a storm of glass. Lightning fast, Mercutio jackknifes to his feet. He raises his weapon to deliver a skull-crushing final blow to the trapped Tybalt. Romeo rushes between them. ROMEO Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio! Seizing the opportunity, Tybalt lunges at Romeo with a lethal triangle of broken glass. He misses, gouging instead a slash of flesh from Mercutio\\'s stomach. A scream of excruciating pain as Mercutio grabs at his bloodied side. Everyone is still. In the abrupt silence, sirens are heard closing in the distance. Abra tugs at Tybalt. ABRA Away Tybalt! They bolt for their vehicle. Benvolio goes to Mercutio. BENVOLIO Art thou hurt? But Mercutio, covering his wound with his hand, laughs. MERCUTIO Ay, ay, a scratch. He turns to his assembled fans at the bottom of the stairs. With outrageous bravado he plays at being Caesar the conqueror. MERCUTIO (CONT.) A scratch! The boys cheer their conquering hero. Romeo helps Mercutio down the stairs. ROMEO Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much. Mercutio holding his bleeding side, jokes through the pain. MERCUTIO \\'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. He turns the next thought to the assembled audience. MERCUTIO (CONT.) (through crazy laughter) A plague o\\' both your houses! Mercutio turns from the cheering boys to Romeo who is struggling to support his weight. Mercutio - through weak and desperate breathing. MERCUTIO (CONT.) Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your arm. Romeo starts to register the panic in Mercutio\\'s eyes. ROMEO I thought all for the best. Like an animal trying to break free from a mortal trap, Mercutio pushes Romeo away. He screams in horror, as if falling in the dark: MERCUTIO A plague o\\' both your houses! They have made worms\\' meat of me. Mercutio staggers down the stairs and collapses in the dirt. Romeo is there instantly, cradling his friend\\'s head out of the dust. The dying boy stares back at Romeo, smiling through the chilling cold. MERCUTIO (CONT.) (a silent whisper) Your houses! Everything stands still, everything is quiet. The storm finally breaks. EXT. BEACH - RAIN. DAY. Tiny drops of water fall from the sky and bespeckle Mercutio\\'s lifeless body. The droplets grow to a heavy rain. Romeo can hear the faint sound a thousand miles away of Benvolio whispering: BENVOLIO Mercutio is dead! Tears streak Romeo\\'s face. He cries out. ROMEO Oh sweet Juliet, Thy beauty hath made me effeminate And in my temper softened valor\\'s steel! The sound of Tybalt\\'s vehicle starting brings back cold reality. Romeo\\'s sorrow turns to uncontrollable rage. Shrugging aside Benvolio\\'s attempts to restrain him, Romeo runs to his car. EXT. BEACH - PARKING LOT. DAY. Up ahead Tybalt\\'s sedan screeches into a fishtailing U-turn and powers away. Romeo jumps into his vehicle. In an effort to head Tybalt off, he guns his damaged machine down a one way street. The rain is now blinding. Romeo stops for nothing; pedestrians flee, cars spin out of control. EXT. VERONA BEACH STREETS - FROM AIR. DAY. AERIAL SHOT: The two cars speed along parallel roads toward Plaza Jesu. Romeo is gaining. EXT. VERONA STREET - CHRIST ROUNDABOUT. DAY. CUT TO: Tybalt\\'s car negotiating the immense roundabout at the foot of the statue of Jesus. EXT. CHRIST ROUNDABOUT. DAY. CUT TO: Romeo\\'s car firing out of the one way street and slamming into Tybalt\\'s car. Tybalt\\'s car careens out of control up the stairs of the statue, clips the fountain, flips, and slides upside down onto the roadway. CUT TO: Tybalt scrambling from his upturned vehicle. CUT TO: Romeo running toward him. SUDDENLY Romeo is halted by Tybalt\\'s drawn gun. Fearlessly marching toward it, he screams through tears. ROMEO Mercutio\\'s soul Is but a little way above our heads, Romeo grabs the barrel of the gun; forcing it between his own eyes, he growls insanely at Tybalt. ROMEO (CONT.) Staying for thine to keep him company. Tybalt, unnerved, tries to back off. TYBALT Thou, wretched boy, shalt with him hence. Romeo, refusing to let go of the gun, forces Tybalt backward through the torrential rain. ROMEO (with frightening intensity) Either thou or I, or both, must go with him. Cars swerve, Romeo is relentless. He grips Tybalt\\'s hand trying to force him to shoot. ROMEO (CONT.) Either thou or I, or both, must go with him. Panicked, Tybalt wrenches free and lurches onto the roadway. Blinded by the headlights of an oncoming car he thuds onto its hood as it skids to a halt. The impact catapults his gun high into the air. Romeo coldly follows its slow motion, spinning trajectory. Real time stretches as the gun dances high above his head. Police sirens, cars swerving, people screaming, and the yelling of panicked commands fade to a nothingness. Romeo stands calmly considering the gun in the air. A harrowing symphonic tone and the echo of Mercutio\\'s voice can be heard. MERCUTIO (V/O) Why the devil came you between us? CUT TO: Patrol cars sliding to a halt. CUT TO: The spinning gun slowly falling to earth. CUT TO: Tybalt rising from the ground. CUT TO: Cops leaping from their cars. CUT TO: The gun landing in Romeo\\'s hand. His eyes full of rage. CUT TO: Cops levelling their revolvers. COP (Romeo in his sights) Put up thy weapon. CUT TO: Real time - Romeo fires three deliberate shots. Tybalt\\'s body convulses backwards against the car, hitting it with a thud, bloodying the shattered windscreen. The cop fires. A bullet grazes Romeo\\'s arm - his gun drops as he screams. ROMEO O, I am fortune\\'s fool! At that moment a roaring hurricane wind hits; blinding police. CLOSE ON: The scaffolding surrounding the Jesus statue. Part of it\\'s canvas covering rips away. Scaffold rains down as the insanely flapping material tries to smash free from it\\'s moorings. Through the mayhem, a rusty Ford driven by Balthasar, slides to a halt. Balthasar screams out at Romeo. BALTHASAR Romeo, away be gone! Stand not amazed! Romeo collapses into the front seat. The cops open fire as Balthasar speeds off into the storm. INT. BALTHASAR\\'S CAR. AFTERNOON. Romeo is bleeding from the bullet graze. EXT. CAUSEWAY. AFTERNOON. The gale-force winds throw waves across the causeway as the fugitives disappear into the black afternoon. CRANE UP: In the distance we see Montague and Capulet towers. Divided by the statue of Christ, they suffer the storm\\'s rage. EXT. MONUMENT. AFTERNOON. Away, below the outstretched arms of Christ, lights from emergency vehicles pulse red through the downpour. THE CAMERA: Falls through heavy rain toward a woman crouched over the lifeless body of Tybalt. She cries: GLORIA Tybalt! Cops nervously eye Fulgencio Capulet and Ted Montague, who, both flanked by body guards, face each other across the crime scene. Medics stand by helplessly as Gloria clings to Tybalt\\'s body. A handcuffed Benvolio looks on. GLORIA (CONT.) Tybalt, my cousin, O my brother\\'s child! O, the blood is spilled of my dear kinsman. Police lines part as Captain Prince arrives. CAPTAIN PRINCE Where are the vile beginners of this fray? Benvolio struggles forward. BENVOLIO O noble Prince I can discover all The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl. Gloria appeals hysterically: GLORIA Prince as thou art true, For blood of ours shed blood of Montague! CAPTAIN PRINCE Benvolio, who began this bloody fray? BENVOLIO (pointing to Tybalt\\'s corpse) There lies the man, slain by young Romeo, That slew thy kinsman brave Mercutio. Gloria interjects savagely. GLORIA He speaks not true! Affection makes him false! BENVOLIO Romeo, that spoke him fair, could not take Truce with the unruly spleen of Tybalt Deaf to peace! GLORIA He is a kinsman to the Montague! I beg for justice which thou Prince must give. Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live! Captain Prince turns to Gloria. CAPTAIN PRINCE Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio. Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe? Ted Montague pleads: MONTAGUE Not Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio\\'s friend; His fault concludes but what the law should end, The life of Tybalt. Captain Prince eyes Montague coldly. CAPTAIN PRINCE And for that offence Immediately we do exile him. Montague, body guards in tow, surges forward. MONTAGUE Noble Prince...? Prince silences him. CAPTAIN PRINCE I will be deaf to pleading and excuses; Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses. Therefore use none. The Captain turns and addresses his assembled officers. CAPTAIN PRINCE (CONT.) Let Romeo hence in haste, Else, when he is found that hour is his last. CLOSE ON: Captain Prince. CAPTAIN PRINCE (CONT.) Bear hence this body and attend our will. Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill. INT. JULIET\\'S BEDROOM. AFTERNOON. An acoustic guitar version of Joy Division\\'s \\'Love Will Tear Us Apart.\\' Juliet traces the path of a raindrop on the window pane as she speaks her thoughts to the storm. JULIET Come gentle night, coming loving black browed night, Give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, Take him and cut him out in little stars, And he will make the face of heaven so fine That all the world will be in love with night, And pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of a love But not possessed it, and though I am sold, Not yet enjoyed. So tedious is this day As is the night before some festival To an impatient child that hath new robes And may not wear them. EXT. CAPULET\\'S MANSION - DRIVEWAY. AFTERNOON. Juliet\\'s P.O.V.: The limousine pulls into the driveway. PULL OUT: Of the window and CRANE DOWN: Juliet runs from the room. EXT. CAPULET MANSION. AFTERNOON. Through the open doorway we see an excited Juliet meet the Nurse at the bottom of the stairs. The music surges. TRACK IN: The Nurse\\'s words are lost in the storm. Juliet buckles. INT. CAPULET MANSION. AFTERNOON. We are close enough now to hear Juliet\\'s words. JULIET Oh God! Did Romeo\\'s hand shed Tybalt\\'s blood? NURSE It did, it did! Alas the day, it did! JULIET Oh serpent heart, hid with a flowering face. Was ever book containing such vile matter So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell In such a gorgeous palace! NURSE There\\'s no trust, No faith, no honesty in men. All perjured, All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers. Shame come to Romeo. JULIET Blistered be thy tongue For such a wish! He was not born to shame. Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit. NURSE Will you speak well of him that killed your cousin? JULIET Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband? Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name When I, thy three-hours wife have mangled it? But whyfore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin? That villain cousin would have killed my husband. All this is comfort, wherefore weep I then? Some word there was worser than Tybalt\\'s death: I would forget it fain - exiled. Tybalt is dead, and Romeo exiled. To speak that word is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet, all slain, All dead. Juliet sinks to the floor, overwhelmed by tears. JULIET (CONT.) Nurse, I\\'ll to my wedding bed, And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead. Nurse looks down at Juliet. She goes and comforts her. NURSE Hie to your chamber. I\\'ll find Romeo To comfort you. I know well where he is. Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night. Juliet looks up through tears. JULIET O find him, give this ring to my true knight, And bid him come to take his last farewell. SLAM MACRO ZOOM: Into the ring. The screen fills with the words \\'I love thee\\'. INT. PRESBYTERY BEDROOM. NIGHT. Romeo lies on the bed shirtless and crying. His wound has been bandaged and Balthasar crouches frightened in the corner. The priest leads the Nurse into the room. Romeo looks up. ROMEO Nurse! She goes to him. NURSE Ah sir! Ah sir! Death\\'s the end of all. ROMEO Speakest thou of Juliet? Where is she? And how doth she? And what says My concealed lady to our cancelled love? NURSE O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps, And then on Romeo cries, and then falls down again. Romeo is wailing inconsolably. ROMEO As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun, Did murder her, as that name\\'s cursed hand murdered her kinsman! Father Laurence shakes the hysterical boy. FATHER LAURENCE I thought thy disposition better tempered! Thy Juliet is alive, There art thou happy. The law that threatened death becomes thy friend And turns it to exile. There art thou happy. A pack of blessings light upon thy back. Romeo calms. The Nurse gives him the ring. NURSE Here sir, a ring my lady bid me give you. Romeo enfolds the ring in his hand. ROMEO How well my comfort is revived by this. The priest goes to his wardrobe, removes a clean white shirt and helps Romeo put it on. FATHER LAURENCE Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed. Ascend her chamber. Hence and comfort her. But look thou stay not till the Watch be set, For then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thou shalt live till we can find a time To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends, Beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back, With twenty hundred thousand times more joy Than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Father Laurence ushers Romeo from the room. INT. HALLWAY. NIGHT. They hurry down the hallway. The priest opens the front door. FATHER LAURENCE Go hence. Be gone by the break of day Sojourn in Mantua. Give me thy hand. Romeo embraces him. ROMEO Farewell. The priest and Balthasar watch as Romeo and the Nurse sprint for the car. INT. CAPULET MANSION. NIGHT. Sobs echo through the house. Dave Paris stands in the entrance hallway clutching a huge bunch of flowers. Fulgencio Capulet stands beside him, whisky glass in hand. CUT TO: Gloria on the upper landing. There is a strange faraway quality about her as she descends to Dave and Capulet. GLORIA She\\'ll not come down tonight. Dave, an understanding smile. DAVE These times of woe afford no times to woo. Capulet guides Dave into the house. CAPULET Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly. GLORIA (joining) And so did I. CAPULET (a cold glance at Gloria) Well, we were born to die. Capulet takes a large slug of whisky. Gloria leans close to Dave. GLORIA I\\'ll know her mind early tomorrow. Tonight she\\'s mewed up to her heaviness. As Gloria, Dave and Capulet exit down the hallway we CRANE UP: toward Juliet\\'s bedroom door. INT. JULIET\\'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. CLOSE ON: Juliet\\'s face. Tears stream onto the pillow. Without warning a hand lightly touches her cheek. Juliet\\'s eyes dart up to discover Romeo standing above her. A still moment of disbelief. Leaning down, Roemo kisses away the tears that fall from her dark, wide eyes. Juliet\\'s lips find Romeo\\'s and they gently sink back onto the bed. INT. SITTING ROOM. NIGHT. Capulet sits in an armchair drinking. Dave and Gloria sit opposite as Capulet whips himself into a frenzy of drunken excitement. CAPULET We\\'ll keep no great ado - a friend or two. For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late, It may be thought we held him carelessly, Being our kinsman if we revel much - But soft what day is this? DAVE Monday my lord. CAPULET Well Wednesday is too soon - what say you to Thursday? Gloria looks up alarmed; Dave is stunned. DAVE My lord I... CAPULET (leaning close) I will make a desperate tender of my child\\'s love. (a drunken good humour) I think she will be ruled in all respects by me; (exploding with hearty laughter) Nay, more, I doubt it not! CUT TO: Gloria, her face hardens. CAPULET (to Dave) But what say you to Thursday? Dave is trying to catch up. DAVE My lord I... CUT TO: Capulet he eyes Dave intently. DAVE (CONT.) I would that Thursday were tomorrow. Delighted, Capulet jumps to his feet. CAPULET A Thursday let it be then! Capulet holds out his glass in toast. Dave and Gloria rise. CAPULET Wife, go you to Juliet ere you go to bed. Tell her, a Thursday she shall be married To this noble sir! CLOSE ON: The glasses clink. EXT. CAPULET ESTATE. DAWN. A pink and gold dawn breaks over Capulet Mansion. INT. JULIET\\'S BEDROOM. DAWN. A tangle of young limbs. Romeo and Juliet blissfully asleep. The dawn light creeps into the room. EXT. CAPULET ESTATE. DAWN. Balthasar\\'s car covertly pulls into a side road near the estate. INT. JULIET\\'S BEDROOM. DAWN. Romeo and Juliet still asleep. CRANE DOWN: Toward the sleeping innocence of the faces. HOLD: A shadow of fear passes across Romeo\\'s features. With a cry of panic, he sits bolt upright. Wide awake, but disorientated, Romeo stares around the room - as Juliet stirs, he remembers where he is. Slipping quietly from the bed, Romeo begins to dress. CLOSE ON: Romeo. A pair of lips enter frame and find his neck. It is Juliet. She hugs herself to him. JULIET Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day. Romeo turns - softly he strokes her cheek. ROMEO I must be gone and live, or stay and die. Juliet kisses his finger-tips. JULIET Yond light is not daylight, And then his cheek... JULIET (CONT.) I know it, I It is some meteor that the sun exhales To light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not to be gone. Romeo, feverishly returning the kisses, throws himself on Juliet. ROMEO Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay than will to go. Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so. Juliet is suddenly still. Romeo kisses her gently. ROMEO (CONT.) How is\\'t, my soul? Let\\'s talk. It is not day. Juliet pulls Romeo to his feet. JULIET It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away! O, now be gone! More light and light it grows. Frantically she helps him into his clothes. ROMEO More light and light: more dark and dark our woes. There is an urgent knocking on the door. They freeze. NURSE (O/S) Madam! JULIET Nurse! NURSE (O/S) Your lady mother is coming to your chamber. JULIET Then, window, let day in, and let life out. Desperately Juliet pulls Romeo out onto the balcony. EXT. BALCONY. DAWN. The storm, now past, has left a morning achingly pure. ROMEO Farewell, farewell. One kiss, and I\\'ll descend. Romeo climbs down from the balcony and into the shadows. JULIET O, think\\'st thou we shall ever meet again? Romeo smiles up at her. ROMEO I doubt it not; Juliet\\'s face darkens. JULIET O God, I have an ill-divining soul. Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low, As one dead in the bottom of a tomb. Romeo scrambles back up to the balcony. ROMEO Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve For sweet discourses in our times to come. From Juliet\\'s bedroom comes the brittle sound of Gloria Capulet\\'s voice. GLORIA Ho daughter! Are you up? Juliet spins around. Gloria has parted the curtains and is staring directly at her daughter. GLORIA Well, well. CUT TO: Romeo sheltered just below the lip of the balcony. FOLLOW: His hand, as it slowly reaches up and touches Juliet\\'s fingers hidden behind her back. Gloria returns to the room. Juliet steals a glance toward Romeo as he silently mouths: ROMEO Adieu, adieu! As Romeo\\'s face disappears into the shadows Juliet whispers a little prayer to herself. JULIET O Fortune, Fortune! Be fickle, Fortune, Fo then I hope thou wilt not keep him long But send him back. INT. JULIET\\'S BEDROOM. DAWN. Juliet is trying not to cry as she goes in to her mother. Gloria turns to her. GLORIA Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy That thou expects not nor I looked not for. Juliet plays along. JULIET Madam, in happy time. What day is that? Gloria takes a deep breath. GLORIA Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn The gallant, young, and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter\\'s Church, Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride. CLOSE ON: Juliet. She can barely speak. JULIET Now by Saint Peter\\'s Church, and Peter too, He shall not make me there a joyful bride! Fear passes across Gloria\\'s face. GLORIA Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself. Capulet - whisky glass in hand - ebulliently bursts into the room. CAPULET How now, wife? Have you delivered to her our decree? GLORIA Ay, sir. But she will none, she gives you thanks. I would the fool were married to her grave! Capulet - a dangerous calm. CAPULET How? Will she none? Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest, Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought So worthy a gentleman to be her bride? JULIET Not proud you have, but thankful that you have. Proud can I never be of what I hate. PAUSE: Capulet considers his daughter, then - BAM! He hurls his glass against the wall, shattering it into a thousand pieces. CAPULET Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds, But fettle your fine joints \\'gainst Thursday next ... Capulet advances. Juliet, terrified, retreats into the hallway. JULIET Hear me with patience but to speak a word... INT. LANDING. DAY. The Nurse appears as Capulet picks his daughter up and shakes her like a rag doll. CAPULET Speak not, reply not, do not answer me! He throws her to the floor. His fist thuds as it slams into her face. GLORIA (screaming) Fie, fie! What are you mad? Gloria tries to restrain Capulet. He back-hands her, sending her flying against the wall - bellowing insanely, he advances on his cowering daughter. CAPULET Hang thee, young baggage! Disobedient wretch. The Nurse throws herself between Capulet and Juliet. NURSE God in heaven bless her! You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so. Furious, Capulet shunts her aside. CAPULET Peace, you mumbling fool! Capulet yanks his daughter\\'s face close to his. CAPULET (CONT.) I tell thee what - get thee to church a Thursday Or never after look me in the face. And you be mine, I\\'ll give you to my friend. And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets, Trust to it. Bethink you. I\\'ll not be forsworn. Capulet storms off down the hall. CLOSE ON: Juliet. She huddles, shaking at the top of the stairs. JULIET O sweet my mother, cast me not away! Delay this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not, make the bridal bed In that dim monument where Tybalt lies. A trickle of blood issues from Gloria\\'s cut lip. She checks her appearance in the hall mirror. GLORIA Talk not to me, for I\\'ll not speak a word. Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee. Gloria leaves. JULIET O God! - O Nurse, how shall this be prevented? The Nurse doesn\\'t reply. JULIET (CONT.) What sayest thou? Hast thou not a word of joy? Some comfort, Nurse. A heavy silence. The Nurse goes to Juliet. NURSE Faith, here it is. I think it best you married with this Paris. O, he\\'s a lovely gentleman! I think you are happy in this second match, For it excels your first; or if it did not, Your first is dead - or \\'twere as good he were As living here and you no use of him. Juliet is very still. JULIET Speakest thou from thy heart? NURSE And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both. JULIET Amen. NURSE (unsure) What? Juliet is matter of fact. JULIET Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much. Go in; and tell my lady I am gone, Having displeased my father, to Friar Laurence, To make confession and to be absolved. The old woman nods. She strokes Juliet\\'s hair. NURSE This is wisely done. Juliet does not look up. A disturbing choral chant: DISSOLVE TO: INT. CHURCH. DAY. Sunlight pierces stained glass - the chant a sinister underscoring. We hear Dave Paris\\' voice: DAVE (O/S) Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt\\'s death... CRANE DOWN: Father Laurence and Dave Paris stand at the front of the church. DAVE (CONT.) ...Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous That she doth give her sorrow so much sway, And in his wisdom hastes our marriage To stop the inundation of her tears... Father Laurence turns. Juliet stands framed in the white glare of the doorway. Dave smiles. DAVE Happily met, my lady and my wife. CLOSE ON: Juliet\\'s hand concealed beneath her coat - we can just see the handle of a gun. Juliet advances slowly, an icy calm: JULIET That may be, sir, when I may be a wife. DAVE That \\'may be\\', must be, love, on Thursday next. Juliet stares past Dave. JULIET What must be, shall be. Father Laurence, a forced cheerfulness. FATHER LAURENCE That\\'s a certain text. DAVE Come you to make confession? Juliet forces a smile. JULIET Are you at leisure, holy father, now? Or shall I come to you at evening mass? FATHER LAURENCE My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now. (to Dave) We must entreat the time alone. DAVE God shield I should disturb devotion! - Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye; Dave bends. CLOSE ON: Juliet; she stares stonily ahead as Dave kisses her cheek. DAVE (CONT.) Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss. Dave leaves. TRACK WITH: Juliet; she runs for the sacristy. The priest follows. INT. SACRISTY. DAY. Juliet, shaking with sobs takes refuge in the shadows of the small room. The priest goes to her. FATHER LAURENCE O Juliet, I already know thy grief. Juliet pulls away. JULIET Tell me not, Father, that thou hearest of this, Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it. FATHER LAURENCE It strains me past the compass of my wits. JULIET (desperately) If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I\\'ll help it presently! She pulls the gun, pointing it towards herself. Horrified, Father Laurence moves to her. Juliet, panicked, levels the gun at him. FATHER LAURENCE Hold daughter! JULIET (through tears) Be not so long to speak. I lone to die! Father Laurence holds out a soothing hand. FATHER LAURENCE I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate an execution As that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake A thing like death... We hear the distended chords of FaurÃ©\\'s Requiem. FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.) to chide away this shame... It continues throughout as; The entire screen fills with a glinting tear drop of blue liquid. Reflected in the fluid\\'s convex surface, the face of Father Laurence. The face disappears as the tear drop falls and splashes into a clear water solution. Like a comet in slow motion, the drop stains the water a cobalt hue. INT. GREENHOUSE WORKROOM. DAY. PULL BACK: The blue liquid fills a tiny glass vial held by Father Laurence. FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.) No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest. Each part, deprived of supple government, Shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning Comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou, dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, And hither shall he come. And that very Night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. The priest cautiously hands Juliet the vial. FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.) Take thou this vial, being then in bed, And this distilling liquor drink thou off. I\\'ll send my letters to thy lord with speed to Mantua. EXT. CHURCH. DAY. As Father Laurence speaks, the screen fills with an express envelope addressed \"Romeo - Mantua.\" The envelope pulls away from the camera and falls into a canvas bag brimming with hundreds of like envelopes. TRACK: With the canvas bag. It continues its journey into the back of an express delivery van. Heavy double doors slam shut, filling the screen with the slogan \\'Speed Express.\\' The van pulls away. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. MANTUA. DAY. A burning red sun is setting over an endless vista of ragged wasteland. CRANE DOWN: A weathered sign reads - Mantua: Behind it a vast colony of permanent trailer homes stretches into the distance. The rap, rap, rap of knocking echoes through the park... CUT TO: The source of the knocking. An express delivery man, envelope in hand, raps vigorously on the door of an unremarkable trailer. INT. TRAILER. DAY. TOPOGRAPHICAL SHOT: Romeo lies flat on a single bed in the crampled trailer. The rap, rap, rap is very loud now. We move toward Romeo and realise he cannot hear the knocking because he has Walkman headphones on. EXT. TRAILER. DAY. Unsuccessful, the delivery man is filling out a \"WE CALLED\" card. He pushes it under the door. DISSOLVE TO: INT. CAPULET MANSION. NIGHT. The heraldic \\'Wedding Chimes\\' by JS Bach. Juliet stands resplendent in a radiant bridal gown. The image floats ethereally in a towering slab of mirror. PULL OUT: From the mirror. The wedding dress is in fact being held in front of Juliet by two members of the house staff. Juliet is dressed in her night gown. The Nurse suggests various pairs of shoes. JULIET (disinterested) Ay, these attires are best. The fuss dispensed with, the staff leave. JULIET But, gentle Nurse, I pray thee leave me to myself tonight. NURSE Why Bride? Juliet navigates the Nurse toward the door. JULIET (almost in tears) To move the heavens to smile upon my state, Which, well thou knowest, is cross and full of sin. Juliet holds the Nurse in a pleading stare. She leaves. Alone now, Juliet hurries to her bedside drawer. She cautiously removes a rolled piece of cloth from which she produces the glass vial. JULIET (whispers) What if this mixture do not work at all? Shall I be married then tomorrow morning? She cautiously begins to unscrew the tiny black lid. Suddenly, a knock at her door. Palming the vial, Juliet swings around to meet the arrival of her mother. Gloria probes her daughter\\'s uneasiness. GLORIA What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help? JULIET (makes light of it) No, madam. We have culled such necessaries As are behoveful for our state tomorrow. So please you, let me now be left alone, And let the Nurse this night sit up with you. Juliet begins to pull down the covers on her bed. JULIET (CONT.) For I am sure you have your hands full all In this so sudden business. Gloria, sensing Juliet\\'s distress, moves cautiously toward her. Taking hold of the bed covers she helps her daughter into bed. GLORIA Good night. Juliet slides into bed. Gloria covers her with the blanket. GLORIA (CONT.) Get thee to bed, and rest, for thou hast need. A brief moment between mother and daughter. Gloria, unable to cross that final barrier, moves to the door; but she is stopped by the urgency in Juliet\\'s voice. JULIET Farewell! Gloria turns to Juliet. JULIET (CONT.) God knows when we shall meet again. CLOSE ON: Gloria. A faint perplexity, and then with an almost warm smile she turns out the light and leaves. The room is in darkness but for patterns of moonlight through windows. TRACK: Toward Juliet. The sombre tones of FaurÃ©\\'s Requiem seep into our consciousness. JULIET I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins That almost freezes up the heat of life. She brings the vial her mouth. JULIET (CONT.) Come, vial. Romeo, I drink to thee. Juliet drinks, a sudden violent convulsion, her face contorts in fear. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. CAPULET ESTATE. DAY. The sky is filled with green and grey clouds. A gusty rain blows the flower arrangements across the lawn. Large white wedding marquees flap in the wind. Through blurring rain, we see ambulances and police vehicles, lights flashing. Father Laurence, accompanied by a dour looking man in black, alights from his car. We follow their P.O.V.: We hear snatches of radio calls. MEDIC ONE (OVER RADIO) Mortal drugs? MEDIC TWO (OVER RADIO) Of lethal quantity as \\'twould render death. INT. CAPULET MANSION - DINING ROOM. DAY. They enter the house and pass the vast dining room, bedecked with wedding decorations. Capulet sits at the large mahogany table. In the background Gloria stares vacantly. Moving swiftly toward a doorway, the music builds. INT. CAPULET MANSION - JULIET\\'S BEDROOM. DAY. The door opens. On the bed Juliet\\'s still body. Father Laurence closes the door. The priest kneels and hastily examines Juliet\\'s pupils. He looks to the man in black who retrieves the glass vial from the floor and pockets it. FATHER LAURENCE (to the man in black) As the custom is, In all her best array bear her to church. When the man in black allows two other dark suited men into the room, it becomes clear he is the undertaker. UNDERTAKER She shall be borne to that same ancient vault Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie. INT. MAUSOLEUM. DAY. A thousand voices proclaim the \\'Song of Ascension.\\' PAN DOWN: From the vaulting glass ceiling of the Capulet mausoleum. On view, enshrined in literally thousands of lit candles, is Juliet\\'s peaceful body. We move through lines of Capulet mourners. In the shadows of the front door a young man hides. CLOSE ON: The young man. We recognise the distressed face of Balthasar. PUSH IN: Balthasar rushes from the Mausoleum. EXT. MANTUA. DAY. We are high above Mantua. Beyond the trailer park stretches a long ribbon of black highway. As a Speed Express van turns off the highway and into the park, we hear Romeo\\'s voice over: ROMEO (V/O) If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep My dreams presage some joyful news at hand... CRANE DOWN: The Express van pulls up at the front office. The driver alights and goes inside. INT. TRAILER. DAY. Romeo sits at the trailer\\'s small kitchen table smoking and writing in his notebook. The \"WE CALLED\" card lies next to an overflowing ashtray. His voice over continues. ROMEO (V/O) And all this day an unaccustomed spirit Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreamt my lady came and found me dead And breathed such life with kisses in my lips That I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed When but love\\'s shadows are so rich in joy. Stubbing out his cigarette, Romeo gazes through the trailer window to see Balthasar\\'s speeding car turn off the highway and into the trailer park. ROMEO News from Verona! An excited Romeo rushes from the trailer. EXT. TRAILER PARK. DAY. CRANE HIGH: Romeo sprints across open ground to intercept Balthasar\\'s car. We see, but Romeo cannot, the Express van approaching from the office. The car slews to a halt and Balthasar jumps out. Romeo yells joyously. ROMEO How now, Balthasar? Bathlasar cannot speak. ROMEO (CONT.) Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my father well? How doth my lady Juliet? That I ask again, For nothing can be ill if she be well. Balthasar does not know how to say what he has come to tell. He looks away. BALTHASAR Then she is well and nothing can be ill. Her body sleeps in Capels\\' monument, And her immortal part with angels lives. I saw her laid low in her kindred\\'s vault. For a long moment Romeo is profoundly still. When he speaks, it is with a chilling calm. ROMEO Is it e\\'en so? Balthasar nods. Romeo turns and stares into the distant wasteland. CLOSE ON: He speaks with bitter determination. ROMEO Then I defy you stars. Romeo moves to the car. ROMEO I will hence tonight. Balthasar tries to restrain him. BALTHASAR Have patience... Exploding with fury, Romeo throws Balthasar against the vehicle. ROMEO Leave me! CUT TO: The Speed Express messenger. Returning to his truck, the priest\\'s undelivered envelope in his hand, the messenger looks toward the two boys. CUT TO: The boys. Balthasar pleads with Romeo. BALTHASAR Your looks are pale and wild and do import Some misadventure. ROMEO (with cold serenity) Tush, thou art deceived. (a niggling thought) Hast thou no letters to me from the Priest? Balthasar shakes his head. Romeo smiles. ROMEO No matter - I will hence tonight. Romeo climbs into the passenger seat of the car. Balthasar reluctantly gets behind the wheel. As silent tears begin to flow, Romeo turns his face to the setting sun. PUSH IN: As he whispers: ROMEO Well Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight. Balthasar\\'s car roars out of the park. CUT TO: The delivery man. He looks to the envelope in his hand, then gets back into his truck. EXT. HIGHWAY. NIGHT. Balthasar\\'s car speeds along the night-time highway. CRANE UP: In the distance the glow of city lights. EXT. ALLEYWAY. NIGHT. Balthasar\\'s car pulls into an alley and stops outside a decrepity apartment block. INT. APARTMENT BLOCK. NIGHT. CLOSE ON: A bespectacled eye peers through the crack of a partly open doorway. Below the face, the barrel of a shotgun protrudes menacingly. CUT TO: Romeo in the dark, paint peeling hallway. ROMEO Let me have A dram of poison, such soon- speeding gear As will disperse itself through all the veins That the life-weary taker may fall dead. The eye considers, a voice rasps back. APOTHECARY Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona\\'s law Is death to any he that utters them. Romeo speaks with fury. ROMEO The world is not thy friend, nor the world\\'s law. Then be not poor, but break it and take this. Romeo shoves a wad of money at THE APOTHECARY\\'S face. BEAT. The rattle of a latch chain and the door swings open. Standing in the doorway is The Apothecary. Sixty something, he has a face scarred with age and abuse. APOTHECARY My poverty, but not my will consents. CLOSE ON: Romeo. ROMEO I pay thy poverty and not thy will. INT. PRESBYTERY. NIGHT. CLOSE ON: Father Laurence. He speaks into the telephone with concern. FATHER LAURENCE Who bore my letter then to Romeo? INT. SPEED EXPRESS DEPOT. NIGHT. A bored clerk is on the other end of the line. The priest\\'s letter is on the counter beside him. CLERK I could not sent it - here it is again. INT. PRESBYTERY. NIGHT. Father Laurence is worried. FATHER LAURENCE By my brotherhood, unhappy fortune! The letter was of dear import. (PAUSE: the priest listens) Adieu. He hangs up the receiver and looks at the wall clock. FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.) Now must I to the monument alone. Within this hour will fair Juliet awake. DISSOLVE FROM: The clock to... INT. APOTHECARY\\'S APARTMENT. NIGHT. CLOSE ON: A cat skitters across a stained formica table. PULL BACK: The Apothecary\\'s apartment is filled with cats. Dozens of feline eyes glow in the dim room. Romeo stands nervously. The Apothecary extracts a small chemist\\'s vial from inside a \\'Statue of Our Lady\\' table lamp - he now speaks with cool professionalism. APOTHECARY Drink it off and if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight. Romeo takes the vial and hands over the money. ROMEO There is my gold - worse poison to men\\'s souls Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell. INT. BALTHASAR\\'S CAR. NIGHT. Motor running, Balthasar waits in the alley outside the apartment building. He checks the rear view mirror and freezes. At the end of the alleyway a police car crawls to a halt. EXT. ALLEYWAY. NIGHT. Romeo exits the building, and as he does so, the streetlight catches his face. The Cop\\'s and Romeo\\'s eyes meet. INT. POLICE CAR. NIGHT. CLOSE ON: The cop. COP This is that banished haughty Montague. INT. BALTHASAR\\'S CAR. Balthasar cracks; he guns the engine and the car lurches forward. EXT. ALLEYWAY. NIGHT. Tires screech as Romeo dives into the passenger seat of Balthasar\\'s moving vehicle. Siren blaring, the police car gives chase. AERIAL SHOT. NIGHT. Balthasar\\'s car winds through traffic - the patrol car gaining. EXT. ANOTHER PART OF TOWN. NIGHT. A police car U-turns over a median strip. EXT. BALTHASAR\\'S CAR. NIGHT. TIGHT ON: A rusted brown hood. The tortured engine screams as Balthasar negotiates the speeding car through city traffic. CRANE UP: Red and blue police light approach fast. INT. PRECINCT OFFICE. NIGHT. Captain Prince barrels through the corridors of police headquarters pulling on his flying jacket. EXT. STREET. NIGHT. TIGHT ON: A smoking tire as it lays rubber to the asphalt. Balthasar grits his teeth as he weaves the car through the impossibly tight space between a container truck and a bus. WHIP PAN: The patrol car is almost upon them when... in a seemingly suicidal manoeuvre Balthasar throws his car into a right-angle turn across four lanes of oncoming traffic. Horns blare. CUT TO: A skidding, squealing, out of control sedan, braking to avoid collision. Miraculously, Balthasar\\'s vehicle shoots out of it its path and onto the other side of the roadway. The sedan slams into the following patrol car. EXT. DRIVEWAY. NIGHT. Balthasar\\'s car speeds into the driveway of the Verona Beach Eternal Rest Cemetery. INT. CHOPPER. NIGHT. Captain Prince scans the night time city below. He speaks to the pilot and the chopper banks sharply. EXT. CEMETERY. NIGHT. CLOSE ON: A stone angel etched against the night sky. PAN DOWN: Romeo pulls a crowbar from the trunk of the parked car. Police sirens sound in the distance. Romeo eyes Balthasar intently. ROMEO Upon thy life, whatever thou hearest Or seest, stand all aloof. Give me the light - Balthasar stands motionless - Romeo rips the torch from his hands and strides into the cemetery. Balthasar follows. BALTHASAR I do beseech you... Romeo turns, punching Balthasar hard; he goes down, blood spurting from his nose. ROMEO Do not interrupt me in my course or By heaven I will tear thee joint by joint And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs! Balthasar slowly rises. Both boys are trying hard not to cry. ROMEO (CONT.) The time and my intents are savage wild, More fierce and more inexorable far Than empty tigers or the roaring sea. BALTHASAR I will be gone and not trouble ye. Romeo smiles. ROMEO So shalt thou show me friendship. They embrace as Romeo whispers. ROMEO (CONT.) Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow. EXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT. CLOSE ON: A crowbar wrenches at ornate glass and iron doors. PULL BACK: The Gothic structure of the mausoleum rears against the night sky. Romeo frenziedly attacks the gates of the small side chapel. ROMEO Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death, Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open. With a final heave the doors scrape open. Silence. ROMEO\\'S P.O.V.: An endless marble corridor lit by hundreds of tiny flickering eternal flames. CLOSE ON: Romeo. He murmurs: ROMEO In despite I\\'ll cram thee with more food. Suddenly a hurricane wind and whirr of machinery: like a huge black insect, Captain Prince\\'s chopper swoops down over the mausoleum. Romeo is caught in the glare of the chopper\\'s burning arc light. Sirens scream, police units race through the cemetery. Blinded, Romeo fires wildly toward the chopper. The police cars screech to a halt. CLOSE ON: A police marksman in the chopper. His finger squeezes the rifle trigger. BANG! A bullet slams into Romeo\\'s shoulder. The other cops open fire and Romeo is sent reeling backwards into the mausoleum in a fusillade of bullets. INT. CHOPPER. NIGHT. An angry Captain Prince bellows into the radio. CAPTAIN PRINCE Hold! Hold! The police hold their fire. INT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT. Bleeding from the shoulder wound, Romeo drags shut the heavy double doors of the chapel. He bangs off three shots through a pane of broken glass and screams at the police. ROMEO Stand all aloof! EXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT. Outside the chopper hovers. Police take up siege positions. Captain Prince\\'s voice echoes through the bullhorn. CAPTAIN PRINCE Romeo, come forth, come forth. INT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT. Romeo uses the crowbar to wedge the doors shut. He bangs off another shot as he yells out at the Police. ROMEO Tempt not a desperate man! Romeo waits. There is no response from the cops. INT. CHOPPER. NIGHT. As the chopper settles to earth, Captain Prince speaks into the radio. CAPTAIN PRINCE Bring forth these enemies Montague and Capulet. INT. PRIEST\\'S CAR. NIGHT. Orange rescue lights reflect through the windshield of the priest\\'s car as it crawls past the crashed sedan and police vehicle. Father Laurence thumps the steering wheel in frustration. FATHER LAURENCE Saint Francis be my speed tonight! Across the road Police swarm around the entrance to the cemetery. FATHER LAURENCE Fear comes upon me. O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing. HOLD ON: The green glow of the car clock as the seconds pulse away. INT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT. TRACK: Down the marble corridor lit by the eternal flames. DISCOVER: Romeo. He weakly stands at the entrance to the viewing chapel. The chapel is dark. As Romeo\\'s eyes adjust he can just see, picked out by a shaft of blue moonlight, the glowing figure of a sleeping girl. He moves down the aisle past the tombs of long-dead Capulets. Romeo is close now. He halts as if in the presence of an unbelievable vision. He lights a match and the room glows gold. The warm light reveals a Juliet even more beautiful in seeming death. Romeo lights some of the hundreds of candles that surround her. ROMEO O my love, my wife, Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath, Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty, Thou art not conquered. Beauty\\'s ensign yet Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, And death\\'s pale flag is not advanced there. Romeo kneels close, as if not wanting to wake a sleeping child. Unconscious tears fall from his eyes as he whispers. ROMEO (CONT.) Ah, dear Juliet, why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe that unsubstantial death Is amorous and keeps thee here in dark To be his paramour? For fear of that I still will stay with thee. Here, oh here Will I set up my everlasting rest And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From this world-wearied flesh. He lays himself close. ROMEO (CONT.) Eyes, look your last. Arms, take your last embrace. And, lips, O you The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss... Gently Romeo kisses Juliet\\'s lips. Ever so slightly, Juliet\\'s hand moves - Romeo does not notice. ROMEO (CONT.) A dateless bargain to engrossing death. Romeo drinks from the vial; the power of the compound is immediate. He convulses and falls, his head resting on Juliet. ROMEO (CONT.) (fighting for breath) O true apothecary, thy drugs are quick. Behind Romeo\\'s head we can see Juliet\\'s eyes opening. Romeo sucks the last few breaths of life into his lungs. Through a blurry consciousness Juliet becomes aware of Romeo. JULIET Oh Romeo, what\\'s here? Forcing herself up, she cradles his head in her arms. Romeo\\'s clear wide eyes stare back, he is completely still but for the sound of weak breaths desperately drawn across motionless lips. Juliet finds the vial clenched in Romeo\\'s hand. Tears slip from her eyes. JULIET (CONT.) Drunk all, and left No friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Haply some poison yet doth hang on them To make me die with a restorative. She delicately kisses Romeo\\'s lips. JULIET (CONT.) (a heart-broken whisper) Thy lips are warm. Desperately the lovers cling to each other. With all his desire to stay alive, Romeo whispers: ROMEO Thus with a kiss I die. There is no breath. He is still. Silence. Sobbing, Juliet hugs the lifeless Romeo to her. JULIET Romeo. O\\' my true love Romeo. She looks to the gun in his hand. EXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT. TRACK: Quickly past Captain Prince and the Capulets taking cover behind a patrol car. Two police officers urgently convey Montague and his wife toward them. Discover Father Laurence arriving. CUT TO: Father Laurence\\'s P.O.V.: Patrol cars, lights flashing, surround the mausoleum. He sees, through the open door of a police car, a hand- cuffed youth. It is Balthasar. Father Laurence hurries to him. It is dawning on Father Laurence. FATHER LAURENCE Balthasar? BALTHASAR (desperately) I brought news of Juliet\\'s death... And then in post came Romeo from Mantua To this same place... to this same monument. CLOSE ON: Father Laurence. FATHER LAURENCE How long hath he been there? BALTHASAR Full half an hour. Father Laurence turns towards the mausoleum. FATHER LAURENCE Romeo. (a shock of realisation) The lady stirs... INT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT. TRACK SLOW TOWARD: Juliet: Sobbing uncontrollably she prises the gun from Romeo\\'s hand. EXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT. Father Laurence, desperate, breaks through the police line and runs toward the mausoleum. CUT TO: The parents and Captain Prince. CAPTAIN PRINCE Hold! Go not forth! INT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT. Juliet turns the gun on herself. EXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT. CLOSE ON: Father Laurence, he screams as he mounts the mausoleum stairs. FATHER LAURENCE The lady stirs! CRACK! The sound of a single gun shot rips through the night. CUT TO: Captain Prince. CUT TO: The parents, a look of cold shock. CUT TO: The priest - his cry echoes through the night. INT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT. Juliet lies peacefully on Romeo\\'s chest. Her eyes awake. A wash of deep red blood floods across them both. As we move away from the forms of the two young lovers lit by a ring of candles, the police burst in, guns ready to resolve what has already been resolved. Continuing up, we pass through the glass dome of the viewing chapel, and over the building. EXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT. There, huddled at the base of the Mausoleum steps, are the Montague and Capulet parents and Father Laurence. From high up we see Captain Prince emerge from the Mausoleum and speak to the group. A moment, then their cries float gently up. EXT. SKY. NIGHT. We are travelling high into the sky now. The cries of the parents and the buzz of radio calls fade to nothing. EXT. VERONA BEACH STREET - CHRIST ROUNDABOUT-FROM AIR. DAWN. As the sun struggled to rise, we push toward the figure of Jesus silently surveying the city. EXT. VERONA BEACH - CHRIST ROUNDABOUT. DAWN. As Jesus\\' face fills the screen, droplets of water begin to streak his cheeks. HOLD: Music swells; the droplets grow to a torrent, and a heavy rain begins to fall. For a long beat, we stay with this image. CRANE DOWN: From the Jesus. A sea of black umbrellas stretches back from the steps of Freedom Tower. EXT. FREEDOM TOWER. DAY. At the top of the steps are a pair of flower strewn caskets. Before the caskets stand Fulgencia and Gloria Capulet, and Ted and Caroline Montague. They stare with blank, uncomprehending sorrow. Among the crowd we see the distraught faces of Benvolio, Balthasar, Father Laurence and the Nurse. The caskets are gently slid into a pair of long black cars. Montague and Capulet descend the stairs. Captain Prince blocks their path. He holds them in his gaze. CAPTAIN PRINCE See what a scourge is laid upon your hate, That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love; And I, for winking at your discords too, Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punished. The Prince steps aside. The procession moves off. Montague and Capulet look to one another, a moment, and then the two adversaries together follow the bodies of their dead children. AERIAL SHOT: The rain falls. Two black cars lead the people of Verona Beach in a sorrowful parade. As the cars pass beneath the towering effigy of Jesus, the image pixilates into a television picture. PULL OUT: A TV anchor woman watches the image on a studio monitor. She turns: ANCHOR WOMAN (to camera) A glooming peace this morning with it brings: The sun for sorrow will not show his head. Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things. Some shall be pardoned, and some punished, For never was a story of more woe Than this of Juliet and her Romeo. The anchor woman changes beat to the next story; but her dialogue fades, and her image gets smaller as the television recedes into a black distance. The music that reminds us most of these two lost lives swells. When the television is very small it is switched off. BLACK SCREEN. HOLD A BEAT. END CREDITS '"
